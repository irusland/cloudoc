A.\n\nEASTER, 1914.\n\n\n\n\nJANUARY\n\nTHE PHEASANT\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHEASANT\n\n\nAs birds are to be considered throughout these pages from any standpoint\nbut that of sport, much that is of interest in connection with a bird\nessentially the sportsman\'s must necessarily be omitted. At the same\ntime, although this gorgeous creature, the chief attraction of social\ngatherings throughout the winter months, appeals chiefly to the men who\nshoot and eat it, it is not uninteresting to the naturalist with\nopportunities for studying its habits under conditions more favourable\nthan those encountered when in pursuit of it with a gun.\n\nIn the first place, with the probable exception of the swan, of which\nsomething is said on a later page, the pheasant stands alone among the\nbirds of our woodlands in its personal interest for the historian. It is\nnot, in fact, a British bird, save by acclimatisation, at all, and is\ngenerally regarded as a legacy of the Romans. The time and manner of its\nintroduction into Britain are, it is true, veiled in obscurity. What we\nknow, on authentic evidence, is that the bird was officially recognised\nin the reign of Harold, and that it had already come under the ægis of\nthe game laws in that of Henry I, during the first year of which the\nAbbot of Amesbury held a licence to kill it, though how he contrived\nthis without a gun is not set forth in detail. Probably it was first\ntreed with the aid of dogs and then shot with bow and arrow. The\noriginal pheasant brought over by the Romans, or by whomsoever may have\nbeen responsible for its naturalisation on English soil, was a\ndark-coloured bird and not the type more familiar nowadays since its\nfrequent crosses with other species from the Far East, as well as with\nseveral ornamental types of yet more recent introduction.\n\nIn tabooing the standpoint of sport, wherever possible, from these\nchapters, occasional reference, where it overlaps the interests of the\nfield-naturalist, is inevitable. Thus there are two matters in which\nboth classes are equally concerned when considering the pheasant. The\nfirst is the real or alleged incompatibility of pheasants and foxes in\nthe same wood. The question of rivalry between pheasant and fox, or (as\nI rather suspect) between those who shoot the one and hunt the other,\nadmits of only one answer. The fox eats the pheasant; the pheasant is\neaten by the fox. This not very complex proposition may read like an\nexcerpt from a French grammar, but it is the epitome of the whole\nargument. It is just possible--we have no actual evidence to go on--that\nunder such wholly natural conditions as survive nowhere in rural England\nthe two might flourish side by side, the fox taking occasional toll of\nits agreeably flavoured neighbours, and the latter, we may suppose,\ntheir wits sharpened by adversity, gradually devising means of keeping\nout of the robber\'s reach. In the artificial environment of a hunting or\nshooting country, however, the fox will always prove too much for a bird\ndulled by much protection, and the only possible _modus vivendi_ between\nthose concerned must rest on a policy of give and take that deliberately\nignores the facts of the case.\n\nMore interesting, on academic grounds at any rate, is the process of\neducation noticeable in pheasants in parts of the country where they\nare regularly shot. Sport is a great educator. Foxes certainly, and\nhares probably, run the faster for being hunted. Indeed the fox appears\nto have acquired its pace solely as the result of the chase, since it\ndoes not figure in the Bible as a swift creature. The genuine wild\npheasant in its native region, a little beyond the Caucasus, is in all\nprobability a very different bird from its half-domesticated kinsman in\nBritain. I have been close to its birthplace, but never even saw a\npheasant there. We are told, on what ground I have been unable to trace,\nthat the polygamous habit in these birds is a product of artificial\nenvironment; but what is even more likely is that the true wild pheasant\nof Western Asia (and not the acclimatised bird so-called in this\ncountry) trusts much less to its legs than our birds, which have long\nsince learnt that there is safety in running. Moreover, though it\nprobably takes wing more readily, it is doubtful whether it flies as\nfast as the pace, something a little short of forty miles an hour, that\nhas been estimated as a common performance in driven birds at home.\n\nThe pheasant is in many respects a very curious bird. At the threshold\nof life, it exhibits, in common with some of its near relations, a\nprecocity very unusual in its class; and the readiness with which\npheasant chicks, only just out of the egg, run about and forage for\nthemselves, is astonishing to those unused to it. Another interesting\nfeature about pheasants is the extraordinary difference in plumage\nbetween the sexes, a gap equalled only between the blackcock and greyhen\nand quite unknown in the partridge, quail and grouse. Yet every now and\nagain, as if resentful of this inequality of wardrobe, an old hen\npheasant will assume male plumage, and this epicene raiment indicates\nbarrenness. Ungallant feminists have been known to cite the case of the\n"mule" pheasant as pointing a moral for the females of a more highly\norganised animal.\n\nThe question of the pheasant\'s natural diet, more particularly where\nthis is not liberally supplemented from artificial sources, brings the\nsportsman in conflict with the farmer, and a demagogue whose zeal\noccasionally outruns his discretion has even endeavoured to cite the\nmangold as its staple food. This, however, is political, and not natural\nhistory. Although, however, like all grain-eating birds, the pheasant is\nno doubt capable of inflicting appreciable damage on cultivated land, it\nseems to be established beyond all question that it also feeds greedily\non the even more destructive larva of the crane-fly, in which case it\nmay more than pay its footing in the fields. The foodstuff most fatal to\nitself is the yew leaf, for which, often with fatal results, it seems to\nhave an unconquerable craving. The worst disease, however, from which\nthe pheasant suffers is "gapes," caused by an accumulation of small red\nworms in the windpipe that all but suffocate the victim.\n\nReference has been made to the bird\'s great speed in the air, as well as\nto its efficiency as a runner. It remains only to add that it is also a\ncreditable swimmer and has been seen to take to water when escaping from\nits enemies.\n\nThe polygamous habit has been mentioned. Ten or twelve eggs, or more,\nare laid in the simple nest of leaves, and this is generally placed on\nthe ground, but occasionally in a low tree or hedge, or even in the\ndisused nest of some other bird.\n\nComparatively few of the birds referred to in the following pages appeal\nstrongly to the epicure, but the pheasant, if not, perhaps, the most\nesteemed of them, is at least a wholesome table bird. It should,\nhowever, always be eaten with chip potatoes and bread sauce, and not in\nthe company of cold lettuce. Those who insist on the English method of\nserving it should quote the learned Freeman, who, when confronted with\nthe Continental alternative, complained bitterly that he was not a\nsilkworm!\n\n\n\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nTHE WOODCOCK\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOODCOCK\n\n\nThere are many reasons why the woodcock should be prized by the winter\nsportsman more than any other bird in the bag. In the first place, there\nis its scarcity. Half a dozen to every hundred pheasants would in most\nparts of the country be considered a proportion at which none could\ngrumble, and there are many days on which not one is either seen or\nshot. Again, there is the bird\'s twisting flight, which, particularly\ninside the covert, makes it anything but an easy target. Third and last,\nit is better to eat than any other of our wild birds, with the possible\nexception of the golden plover. Taking one consideration with another,\nthen, it is not surprising that the first warning cry of "Woodcock\nover!" from the beaters should be the signal for a sharp and somewhat\nerratic fusillade along the line, a salvo which the beaters themselves\nusually honour by crouching out of harm\'s way, since they know from\nexperience that even ordinarily cool and collected shots are sometimes\napt to be fired with a sudden zeal to shoot the little bird, which may\ncost one of them his eyesight. According to the poet,\n\n    "Lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade;"\n\nand so no doubt they do at meal-time after sunset, but we are more used\nto flushing them amid dry bracken or in the course of some frozen ditch.\nQuite apart, however, from its exhilarating effect on the sportsman, the\nbird has quieter interests for the naturalist, since in its food, its\nbreeding habits, its travels, and its appearance it combines more\npeculiarities than perhaps any other bird, certainly than any other of\nthe sportsman\'s birds, in these islands. It is not, legally speaking, a\ngame bird and was not included in the Act of 1824, but a game licence is\nrequired for shooting it, and it enjoys since 1880 the protection\naccorded to other wild birds. This is excellent, so far as it goes, but\nit ought to be protected during the same period as the pheasant,\nparticularly now that it is once more established as a resident species\nall over Britain and Ireland.\n\nThis new epoch in the history of its adventures in these islands is the\nwork of the Wild Birds\' Protection Acts. In olden times, when half of\nBritain was under forest, and when guns were not yet invented that could\n"shoot flying," woodcocks must have been much more plentiful than they\nare to-day. In those times the bird was taken on the ground in springes\nor, when "roding" in the mating season, in nets, known as "shots," that\nwere hung between the trees. When the forest area receded, the resident\nbirds must have dwindled to the verge of extinction, for on more than\none occasion we find even a seasoned sportsman like Colonel Hawker\nworked up to a rare pitch of excitement after shooting woodcock in a\npart of Hampshire where in our day these birds breed regularly. Thanks,\nhowever, to the protection afforded by the law, there is once again\nprobably no county in England in which woodcocks do not nest.\n\nAt the same time, it is as an autumn visitor that, with the first of the\neast wind in October or November, we look for this untiring little\ntraveller from the Continent. Some people are of opinion that since it\nhas extended its residential range fewer come oversea to swell the\nnumbers, but the arrivals are in some years considerable, and if a\nstricter watch were kept on unlicensed gunners along the foreshore of\nEast Anglia, very much larger numbers would find their way westwards\ninstead of to Leadenhall. As it is, the wanderers arrive, not\nnecessarily, as has been freely asserted, in poor condition, but always\ntired out by their journey, and numbers are secured before they have\ntime to recover their strength. Yet those which do recover fly right\nacross England, some continuing the journey to Ireland, and stragglers\neven, with help no doubt from easterly gales, having been known to reach\nAmerica.\n\nThe woodcock is interesting as a parent because it is one of the very\nfew birds that carry their young from place to place, and the only\nBritish bird that transports them clasped between her legs. A few\nothers, like the swans and grebes, bear the young ones on the back, but\nthe woodcock\'s method is unique. Scopoli first drew attention to his own\nversion of the habit in the words "_pullos rostro portat_," and it was\nold Gilbert White who, with his usual eye to the practical, doubted\nwhether so long and slender a bill could be turned to such a purpose.\nMore recent observation has confirmed White\'s objection and has\nestablished the fact of the woodcock holding the young one between her\nthighs, the beak being apparently used to steady her burden. Whether the\nlittle ones are habitually carried about in this fashion, or merely on\noccasion of danger, is not known, and indeed the bird\'s preference for\nactivity in the dusk has invested accurate observation of its habits\nwith some difficulty. Among well-known sportsmen who were actually so\nfortunate as to have witnessed this interesting performance, passing\nmention may be made of the late Duke of Beaufort, the Hon. Grantley\nBerkeley, and Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey.\n\nReference has already been made to the now obsolete use of nets for the\ncapture of these birds when "roding." The cock-shuts, as they were\ncalled, were spread so as to do their work after sundown, and this is\nthe meaning of Shakespeare\'s allusion to "cock-shut time." This "roding"\nis a curious performance on the part of the males only, and it bears\nsome analogy to the "drumming" of snipe. It is accompanied indeed by the\nsame vibrating noise, which may be produced from the throat as well,\nbut is more probably made only by the beating of the wings. There\nappears to be some divergence of opinion as to its origin in both birds,\nthough in that of the snipe such sound authorities as Messrs. Abel\nChapman and Harting are convinced that it proceeds from the quivering of\nthe primaries, as the large quill-feathers of the wings are called.\nOther naturalists, however, have preferred to associate it with the\nspreading tail-feathers. Whether these eccentric gymnastics are\nperformed as displays, with a view to impressing admiring females, or\nwhether they are merely the result of excitement at the pairing season\ncannot be determined. It is safe to assume that they aim at one or other\nof these objects, and further no one can go with any certainty. The word\n"roding" is spelt "roading" by Newton, who thus gives the preference to\nthe Anglo-Saxon description of the aërial tracks followed by the bird,\nover the alternative derivation from the French "roder," which means to\nwander. The flight is at any rate wholly different from that to which\nthe sportsman is accustomed when one of these birds is flushed in\ncovert. In the latter case, either instinct or experience seems to have\ntaught it extraordinary tricks of zigzag man[oe]uvring that not seldom\nsave its life from a long line of over-anxious guns; though out in the\nopen, where it generally flies in a straight line for the nearest\ncovert, few birds of its size are easier to bring down. Fortunately, we\ndo not in England shoot the bird in springtime, the season of "roding,"\nbut the practice is in vogue in the evening twilight in every\nContinental country, and large bags are made in this fashion.\n\nIn its hungry moments the woodcock, like the snipe, has at once the\nadvantages and handicap of so long a beak. On hard ground, in a long\nspell of either drought or frost, it must come within measurable\ndistance of starvation, for its only manner of procuring its food in\nnormal surroundings is to thrust its bill deep into the soft mud in\nsearch of earthworms. The bird does not, it is true, as was once\ncommonly believed, live by suction, or, as the Irish peasants say in\nsome parts, on water, but such a mistake might well be excused in anyone\nwho had watched the bird\'s manner of digging for its food in the ooze.\nThe long bill is exceedingly sensitive at the tip, and in all\nprobability, by the aid of a tactile sense more highly developed than\nany other in our acquaintance, this organ conveys to its owner the\nwhereabouts of worms wriggling silently down out of harm\'s way. On first\nreaching Britain, the woodcock remains for a few days on the seashore to\nrecover from its crossing, and at this time of rest it trips over the\nwet sand, generally in the gloaming, and picks up shrimps and such other\nsoft food as is uncovered between tidal marks. It is not among the\neasiest of birds to keep for any length of time in captivity, but if due\nattention be paid to its somewhat difficult requirements in the way of\nsuitable food, success is not unattainable. On the whole, bread and milk\nhas been found the best artificial substitute for its natural diet. With\nthe _kiwi_ of New Zealand, a bird not even distantly related to the\nwoodcock, and a cousin rather of the ostrich, but equipped with much the\nsame kind of bill as the subject of these remarks, an even closer\nimitation of the natural food has been found possible in menageries.\nThe bill of the _kiwi_, which has the nostrils close to the tip, is even\nmore sensitive than that of the woodcock and is employed in very similar\nfashion. At Regent\'s Park the keeper supplies the bird with fresh worms\nso long as the ground is soft enough for spade-work. They are left in a\npan, and the _kiwi_ eats them during the night. In winter, however, when\nworms are not only hard to come by in sufficient quantity but also\nfrost-bitten and in poor condition, an efficient substitute is found in\nshredded fillet steak, which, whether it accepts it for worms or not,\nthe New Zealander devours with the same relish.\n\nWhen a woodcock lies motionless among dead leaves, it is one of the most\nstriking illustrations of protective colouring to be found anywhere.\nTime and again the sportsman all but treads on one, which is betrayed\nonly by its large bright eye. There are men who, in their eagerness to\nadd it to the bag, do not hesitate in such circumstances to shoot a\nwoodcock on the ground, but a man so fond of ground game should\ncertainly be refused a game licence and should be allowed to shoot\nnothing but rabbits.\n\n\n\n\nMARCH\n\nTHE WOODPIGEON\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOODPIGEON\n\n\nThe woodpigeon is many things to many men. To the farmer, who has some\nclaim to priority of verdict, it is a curse, even as the rabbit in\nAustralia, the lemming in Norway, or the locust in Algeria. The tiller\nof the soil, whose business brings him in open competition with the\nnatural appetites of such voracious birds, beasts, or insects, regards\nhis rivals from a standpoint which has no room for sentiment; and the\nwoodpigeons are to our farmers, particularly in the well-wooded\ndistricts of the West Country, even as Carthage was to Cato the Censor,\nsomething to be destroyed.\n\nIt is this attitude of the farmer which makes the woodpigeon\npre-eminently the bird of February. All through the shooting season just\nended, a high pigeon has proved an irresistible temptation to the guns,\nwhether cleaving the sky above the tree-tops, doubling behind a broad\nelm, or suddenly swinging out of a gaunt fir. Yet it is in February,\nwhen other shooting is at an end and the coverts no longer echo the\nfusillade of the past four months, that the farmers, furious at the\nsight of green root-crops grazed as close as by sheep and of young\nclover dug up over every acre of their tilling, welcome the co-operation\nof sportsmen glad to use up the balance of their cartridges in organised\npigeon battues. These gatherings have, during the past five years,\nbecome an annual function in parts of Devonshire and the neighbouring\ncounties, and if the bag is somewhat small in proportion to the guns\nengaged, a wholesome spirit of sport informs those who take part, and\nthere is a curiously utilitarian atmosphere about the proceedings.\nEveryone seems conscious that, in place of the usual idle pleasure of\nthe covert-side or among the turnips, he is out for a purpose, not\nmerely killing birds that have been reared to make his holiday, but\nactually helping the farmers in their fight against Nature. As,\nmoreover, recent scares of an epidemic not unlike diphtheria have\nprecluded the use of the birds for table purposes, the powder is burnt\nwith no thought of the pot.\n\nThe usual plan is to divide the guns in small parties and to post these\nin neighbouring plantations or lining hedges overlooking these spinneys.\nAt a given signal the firing commences and is kept up for several hours,\na number of the marauders being killed and the rest so harried that many\nof them must leave the neighbourhood, only to find a similar warm\nwelcome across the border. Some such concerted attack has of late years\nbeen rendered necessary by the great increase in the winter invasion\nfrom overseas. It is probable that, as most writers on the subject\ninsist, the wanderings of these birds are for the most part restricted\nto these islands and are mere food forays, like those which cause\nlocusts to desert a district that they have stripped bare for pastures\nnew. At the same time, it seems to be beyond all doubt the fact that\nhuge flocks of woodpigeons reach our shores annually from Scandinavia,\nand their inroads have had such serious results that it is only by joint\naction that their numbers can be kept under. For such work February is\nobviously the month, not only because most of their damage to the\ngrowing crops and seeds is accomplished at this season, but also\nbecause large numbers of gunners, no longer able to shoot game, are thus\nat the disposal of the farmers and only too glad to prolong their\nshooting for a few weeks to such good purpose.\n\nMany birds are greedy. The cormorant has a higher reputation of the sort\nto live up to than even the hog, and some of the hornbills, though less\nfamiliar, are endowed with Gargantuan appetites. Yet the ringdove could\nprobably vie with any of them. Mr. Harting mentions having found in the\ncrop of one of these birds thirty-three acorns and forty-four\nbeech-nuts, while no fewer than 139 of the latter were taken, together\nwith other food remains, from another. It is no uncommon experience to\nsee the crop of a woodpigeon that is brought down from a great height\nburst, on reaching the earth, with a report like that of a pistol, and\nscatter its undigested contents broadcast. Little wonder then, that the\nfarmers welcome the slaughter of so formidable a competitor! It is one\nof their biggest customers, and pays nothing for their produce. One told\nme, not long ago, that the woodpigeons had got at a little patch of\nyoung rape, only a few acres in all, which had been uncovered by the\ndrifting snow, and had laid it as bare as if the earth had never been\nplanted. Seeing what hearty meals the woodpigeon makes, it is not\nsurprising that it should sometimes throw up pellets of undigested\nmaterial. This is not, however, a regular habit, as in the case of hawks\nand owls, and is rather, perhaps, the result of some abnormally\nirritating food.\n\nPigeons digest their food with the aid of a secretion in the crop, and\nit is on this soft material, popularly known as "pigeons\' milk," that\nthey feed their nestlings. This method suggests analogy to that of the\npetrels, which rear their young on fish-oil partly digested after the\nsame fashion. Indeed, all the pigeons are devoted parents. Though the\nmajority build only a very pretentious platform of sticks for the two\neggs, they sit very close and feed the young ones untiringly. Some of\nthe pigeons of Australia, indeed, go even further. Not only do they\nbuild a much more substantial nest of leafy twigs, but the male bird\nactually sits throughout the day, such paternal sense of duty being all\nthe more remarkable from the fact that these pigeons of the Antipodes\nusually lay but a single egg. Australia, with the neighbouring islands,\nmust be a perfect paradise for pigeons, since about half of the species\nknown to science occur in that region only. The wonga-wonga and\nbronze-wing and great fruit-pigeons are, like the "bald-pates" of\nJamaica, all favourite birds with sportsmen, and some of the birds are\nfar more brightly coloured than ours. It is, however, noticeable that\neven the gayest Queensland species, with wings shot with every prismatic\nhue, are dull-looking birds seen from above, and the late Dr. A. R.\nWallace regarded this as affording protection against keen-eyed hawks on\nthe forage. His ingenious theory receives support from the well-known\nfact that in many of the islands, where pigeons are even more plentiful,\nbut where also hawks are few, the former wear bright clothes on their\nback as well.\n\nThe woodpigeon has many names in rural England. That by which it is\nreferred to in the foregoing notes is not, perhaps, the most\nsatisfactory, since, with the possible exception of the smaller\nstock-dove, which lays its eggs in rabbit burrows, and the rock-dove,\nwhich nests in the cliffs, all the members of the family need trees, if\nonly to roost and nest in. A more descriptive name is that of ringdove,\neasily explained by the white collar, but the bird is also known as\ncushat, queest, or even culver. The last-named, however, which will be\nfamiliar to readers of Tennyson, probably alludes specifically to the\nrock-dove, as it undoubtedly gave its name to Culver Cliff, a prominent\nlandmark in the Isle of Wight, where these birds have at all times been\nsparingly in evidence.\n\nThe ringdove occasionally rears a nestling in captivity, but it does not\nseem, at any time of life, to prove a very attractive pet. White found\nit strangely ferocious, and another writer describes it as listless and\nuninteresting. The only notable success on record is that scored by St.\nJohn, who set some of the eggs under a tame pigeon and secured one\nsurvivor that appears to have grown quite tame, but was, unfortunately,\neaten by a hawk. At any rate, it did its kind good service by enlisting\non their side the pen of the most ardent apologist they have ever had.\nIndeed, St. John did not hesitate to rate the farmers soundly for\npersecuting the bird in wilful ignorance of its unpaid services in\nclearing their ground of noxious weeds. Yet, however true his eloquent\nplea may have been in respect of his native Lothian, there would be some\ndifficulty in persuading South Country agriculturists of the\nwoodpigeon\'s hidden virtues. To those, however, who do not sow that they\nmay reap, the subject of these remarks has irresistible charm. There is\ndoubtless monotony in its cooing, yet, heard in a still plantation of\nfirs, with no other sound than perhaps the distant call of a shepherd or\nbarking of a farm dog, it is a music singularly in harmony with the\npeaceful scene. The arrowy flight of these birds when they come in from\nthe fields at sundown and fall like rushing waters on the tree-tops is\nan even more memorable sound. To the sportsman, above all, the\nwoodpigeon shows itself a splendid bird of freedom, more cunning than\nany hand-reared game bird, swifter on the wing than any other purely\nwild bird, a welcome addition to the bag because it is hard to shoot in\nthe open, and because in life it was a sore trial to a class already\nharassed with their share of this life\'s troubles.\n\n\n\n\nAPRIL\n\nBIRDS IN THE HIGH HALL GARDEN\n\n\n\n\nBIRDS IN THE HIGH HALL GARDEN\n\n\nAll March the rooks were busy in the swaying elms, but it is these\nsofter evenings of April, when the first young leaves are beginning to\nframe the finished nests, and the boisterous winds of last month no\nlonger drown the babble of the tree-top parliament at the still hour\nwhen farm labourers are homing from the fields, that the rooks\npeculiarly strike their own note in the country scene. There is no good\nreason to confuse these curious and interesting fowl with any other of\nthe crow family. Collectively they may be recognised by their love of\nfellowship, for none are more sociable than they. Individually the rook\nis stamped unmistakably by the bald patch on the face, where the\nfeathers have come away round the base of the beak. The most generally\naccepted explanation of this disfigurement is the rook\'s habit of\nthrusting its bill deep in the earth in search of its daily food. This,\non the face of it, looks like a reasonable explanation, but it should be\nborne in mind that not only do some individual rooks retain through\nlife the feathers normally missing, but that several of the rook\'s\ncousins dip into Nature\'s larder in the same fashion without suffering\nany such loss. However, the featherless patch on the rook\'s cheeks\nsuffices, whatever its cause, as a mark by which to recognise the bird\nliving or dead.\n\nUnlike its cousin the jackdaw, which commonly nests in the cliffs, the\nrook is not, perhaps, commonly associated with the immediate\nneighbourhood of the sea, but a colony close to my own home in\nDevonshire displays sufficiently interesting adaptation to estuarine\nconditions to be worth passing mention. Just in the same way that gulls\nmake free of the wireworms on windswept ploughlands, so in early summer\ndo the old rooks come sweeping down from the elms on the hill that\noverlooks my fishing ground and take their share of cockles and other\nmuddy fare in the bank uncovered by the falling tide. Here, in company\nwith gulls, turnstones, and other fowl of the foreshore, the rooks strut\nimportantly up and down, digging their powerful bills deep in the ooze\nand occasionally bullying weaker neighbours out of their hard-earned\nspoils. The rook is a villain, yet there is something irresistible in\nthe effrontery with which one will hop sidelong on a gorging gull, which\nbeats a hasty retreat before its sable rival, leaving some half-prized\nshellfish to be swallowed at sight or carried to the greedy little beaks\nin the tree-tops. While rooks are far more sociable than crows, the two\nare often seen in company, not always on the best of terms, but usually\nin a condition suggestive of armed neutrality. An occasional crow visits\nmy estuary at low tide, but, though the bird would be a match for any\nsingle rook, I never saw any fighting between them. Possibly the crow\nfeels its loneliness and realises that in case of trouble none of its\nbrothers are there to see fair play. Yet carrion crows, like herons, are\namong the rook\'s most determined enemies, and cases of rookeries being\ndestroyed by both birds are on record. On the other hand, though the\nheron is the far more powerful bird of the two, heronries have likewise\nbeen scattered, and their trees appropriated, by rooks, probably in\noverwhelming numbers. Of the two the heron is, particularly in the\nvicinity of a preserved trout stream, the more costly neighbour. Indeed\nit is the only other bird which nests in colonies of such extent, but\nthere is this marked difference between herons and rooks, that the\nformer are sociable only in the colony. When away on its own business,\nthe heron is among the most solitary of birds, having no doubt, like\nmany other fishermen, learnt the advantage of its own company.\n\nOne of the most remarkable habits in the rook is that of visiting the\nold nests in mid-winter. Now and again, it is true, a case of actually\nnesting at that season has been noticed, but the fancy for sporting\nround the deserted nests is something quite different from this. I have\nwatched the birds at the nests on short winter days year after year, but\nnever yet saw any confirmation of the widely accepted view that their\nobject is the putting in order of their battered homes for the next\nseason. It seems a likely reason, but in that case the birds would\nsurely be seen carrying twigs for the purpose, and I never saw them do\nso before January. What other attraction the empty nurseries can have\nfor them is a mystery, unless indeed they are sentimental enough to like\nrevisiting old scenes and cawing over old memories.\n\nThe proximity of a rookery does not affect all people alike. Some who,\nordinarily dwelling in cities, suffer from lack of bird neighbours,\nwould regard the deliberate destruction of a rookery as an act of\nvandalism. A few, as a matter of fact, actually set about establishing\nsuch a colony where none previously existed, an ambition that may\ngenerally be accomplished without extreme difficulty. All that is needed\nis to transplant a nest or two of young rooks and lodge them in suitable\ntrees. The parent birds usually follow, rear the broods, and forthwith\nfound a settlement for future generations to return to. Even artificial\nnests, with suitable supplies of food, have succeeded, and it seems that\nthe rook is nowhere a very difficult neighbour to attract and establish.\n\nWhy are rooks more sociable than ravens, and what do they gain from such\ncommunalism? These are favourite questions with persons informed with an\nintelligent passion for acquiring information, and the best answer,\nwithout any thought of irreverence, is "God knows!" It is most certain\nthat we, at any rate, do not. So far from explaining how it was that\nrooks came to build their nests in company, we cannot even guess how the\nmajority of birds came to build nests at all, instead of remaining\nsatisfied with the simpler plan of laying their eggs in the ground that\nis still good enough for the petrels, penguins, kingfishers, and many\nother kinds. Protection of the eggs from rain, frost, and natural\nenemies suggests itself as the object of the nest, but the last only\nwould to some extent be furthered by the gregarious habit, and even so\nwe have no clue as to why it should be any more necessary for rooks than\nfor crows. To quote, as some writers do, the numerical superiority of\nrooks over ravens as evidence of the benefits of communal nesting is to\nignore the long hostility of shepherds towards the latter birds on which\ncenturies of persecution have told irreparably. Rooks, on the other\nhand, though also regarded in some parts of these islands as suspects,\nhave never been harassed to the same extent; and if anything in the\nnature of general warfare were to be inaugurated against them, the\ngregarious habit, so far from being a protection, would speedily and\ndisastrously facilitate their extermination. Another curious habit\nnoticed in these birds is that of flying on fine evenings to a\nconsiderable height and then swooping suddenly to earth, often on their\nbacks. These antics, comparable to the drumming of snipe and roding of\nwoodcock, are probably to be explained on the same basis of sexual\nemotion.\n\nThe so-called parliament of the rooks probably owes much of its detail\nto the florid imagination of enthusiasts, always ready to exaggerate the\nwonders of Nature; but it also seems to have some existence in fact, and\nprivileged observers have actually described the trial and punishment of\nindividuals that have broken the laws of the commune. I never saw this\nprocedure among rooks, but once watched something very similar among the\nfamous dogs of Constantinople, which no longer exist.\n\nThe most important problem however in connection with the rook is the\nprecise extent to which the bird is the farmer\'s enemy or his friend. On\nthe solution hangs the rook\'s fate in an increasingly practical age,\nwhich may at any moment put sentiment on one side and decree for it the\nfate that is already overtaking its big cousin the raven. Scotch farmers\nhave long turned their thumbs down and regarded rooks as food for the\ngun, but in South Britain the bird\'s apologists have hitherto been able\nto hold their own and avert catastrophe from their favourite. The\nevidence is conflicting. On the one hand, it seems undeniable that the\nrook eats grain and potato shoots. It also snaps young twigs off the\ntrees and may, like the jay and magpie, destroy the eggs of game birds.\nOn the other hand, particularly during the weeks when it is feeding its\nnestlings, it admittedly devours quantities of wireworms, leathergrubs,\nand weevils, as well as of couch grass and other noxious weeds, while\nsome of its favourite dainties, such as thistles, walnuts, and acorns,\nwill hardly be grudged at any time. It is not an easy matter to decide;\nand, if the rook is to be spared, economy must be tempered with\nsentiment, in which case the evidence will perhaps be found to justify a\nverdict of guilty, with a strong recommendation to mercy.\n\n\n\n\nMAY\n\nTHE CUCKOO\n\n\n\n\nTHE CUCKOO\n\n\nWith the single exception of the nightingale, bird of lovers, no other\nhas been more written of in prose or verse than the so-called "harbinger\nof spring." This is a foolish name for a visitor that does not reach our\nshores before, at any rate, the middle of April. Even _Whitaker_ allows\nus to recognise the coming of spring nearly a month earlier; and for\nmyself, impatient if only for the illusion of Nature\'s awakening, I date\nmy spring from the ending of the shortest day. Once the days begin to\nlengthen, it is time to glance at the elms for the return of the rooks\nand to get out one\'s fishing-tackle again. Yet the cuckoo comes rarely\nbefore the third week of April, save in the fervent imagination of\npremature heralds, who, giving rein to a fancy winged by desire, or\nhonestly deceived by some village cuckoo clock heard on their country\nrambles, solemnly write to the papers announcing the inevitable March\ncuckoo. They know better in the Channel Islands, for in the second week\nof April, and not before, there are cuckoos in every bush--hundreds of\nexhausted travellers pausing for strength to complete the rest of their\njourney to Britain. Not on the return migration in August do the\nwanderers assemble in the islands, since, having but lately set out,\nthey are not yet weary enough to need the rest. The only district of\nEngland in which I have heard of similar gatherings of cuckoos is East\nAnglia, where, about the time of their arrival, they regularly collect\nin the bushes and indulge in preliminary gambols before flying north and\nwest.\n\nCuckoos, then, reach these islands about the third week of April, and\nthey leave us again at the end of the summer, the old birds flying south\nin July, the younger generation following three or four weeks later.\nGoodness knows by what extraordinary instinct these young ones know the\nway. But the young cuckoo is a marvel altogether in the manner of its\neducation, since, when one comes to think of it, it has no upbringing by\nits own parents and cannot even learn how to cry "Cuckoo!" by example or\ninstruction. Its foster-parents speak another language, and its own\nfolk have ceased from singing by the time it is out of the nest. A good\ndeal has been written about the way in which the note varies, chiefly in\nthe direction of greater harshness and a more staccato and less\nsustained note, towards the end of the cuckoo\'s stay. According to the\nrustic rhyme, it changes its tune in June, which is probably poetic\nlicence rather than the fruits of actual observation. It is, however,\ncommonly agreed that the cuckoo is less often heard as the time of its\ndeparture draws near, and the easiest explanation of its silence, once\nthe breeding season is ended, is that the note, being the love-call of a\npolygamous bird, is no longer needed.\n\nIn Australia the female cuckoo is handsomely barred with white, whereas\nthe male is uniformly black; but with our bird it is exceedingly\ndifficult to distinguish one sex from the other on the wing, and, were\nit not for occasional evidence of females having been shot when actually\ncalling, we might still believe that it is the male only that makes this\nsound. The note is joyous only in the poet\'s fancy, just as he has also\nread sadness into the "sobbing" of the nightingale. There is, indeed,\nwhen we consider its life, something fantastic in the hypothesis that\nthe cuckoo can know no trouble in life, merely because it escapes the\nrigours of our winter. Eternal summer must be a delight, but the cuckoo\nhas to work hard for the privilege, and it must at times be harried to\nthe verge of desperation by the small birds that continually mob it in\nbroad daylight. This behaviour on the part of its pertinacious little\nneighbours has been the occasion of much futile speculation; but the one\ncertain result of such persecution is to make the cuckoo, along with its\nfellow-sufferer, the owls, preferably active in the sweet peace of the\ngloaming, when its puny tyrants are gone to roost. Much heated argument\nhas raged round the real or supposed sentiment that inspires such\ndemonstrations on the part of linnets, sparrows, chaffinches, and other\ndetermined hunters of the cuckoo. It seems impossible, when we observe\nthe larger bird\'s unmistakable desire to win free of them, to attribute\nfriendly feelings to its pursuers. Yet some writers have held the\ncurious belief that, with lingering memories of the days when, a year\nago, they devoted themselves to the ugly foster-child, the little birds\nstill regard the stranger with affection. If so, then they have an\neccentric way of showing it, and the cuckoo, driven by the chattering\nlittle termagants from pillar to post, may well pray to be saved from\nits friends. On the other hand, even though convinced of their\nhostility, it is not easy to believe, as some folks tell us, that they\nmistake the cuckoo for a hawk. Even the human eye, though slower to take\nnote of such differences, can distinguish between the two, and the\ncuckoo\'s note would still further undeceive them. The most satisfactory\nexplanation of all perhaps is that the nest memories do in truth\nsurvive, not, however, investing the cuckoo with a halo of romance, but\nrather branding it as an object of suspicion, an interloper, to be\ndriven out of the neighbourhood at all costs ere it has time to billet\nits offspring on the hard-working residents. All of which is, needless\nto say, the merest guesswork, since any attempt to interpret the\nsimplest actions of birds is likely to lead us into erroneous\nconclusions. Yet, of the two, it certainly seems more reasonable to\nregard the smaller birds as resenting the parasitic habit in the cuckoo\nthan to admit that they can actually welcome the murder of their own\noffspring to make room in the nest for the ugly changeling foisted on\nthem by this fly-by-night.\n\nOn the _lucus a non lucendo_ principle, the cuckoo is chiefly\ninteresting as a parent. The bare fact is that our British kind builds\nno nest of its own, but puts its eggs out to hatch, choosing for the\npurpose the nests of numerous small birds which it knows to be suitable.\nFurther investigation of the habits of this not very secretive bird,\nshows that she first lays her egg on the ground and then carries it in\nher bill to a neighbouring nest. Whether she first chooses the nest and\nthen lays the egg destined to be hatched in it, or whether she lays each\negg when so moved and then hunts about for a home for it, has never been\nascertained. The former method seems the more practical of the two. On\nthe other hand, little nests of the right sort are so plentiful in May\nthat, with her mother-instinct to guide her, she could always find one\nat a few moments\' notice. Some people, who are never so happy as when\nmaking the wonders of Nature seem still more wonderful than they really\nare, have declared that the cuckoo lays eggs to match those among which\nshe deposits them, or that, at any rate, she chooses the nests of birds\nwhose eggs approximately resemble her own. I should have liked to\nbelieve this, but am unfortunately debarred by the memory of about forty\ncuckoo\'s eggs that I took, seven-and-twenty summers ago, in the woods\nround Dartford Heath. The majority of these were found in hedgesparrows\'\nnests, and the absolute dissimilarity between the great spotted egg of\nthe cuckoo and the little blue egg of its so-called dupe would have\nimpressed even a colour-blind animal. Occasionally, I believe, a blue\ncuckoo\'s egg has been found, but such a freak could hardly be the result\nof design. As a matter of fact, there is no need for any such elaborate\ndeception. Up to the moment of hatching, the little foster-parents have\nin all probability no suspicion of the trick that has been played on\nthem. Birds do not take deliberate notice of the size or colour of\ntheir own eggs. Kearton somewhere relates how he once induced a\nblackbird to sit on the eggs of a thrush, and a lapwing on those of a\nredshank. So, too, farmyard hens will hatch the eggs of ducks or game\nbirds and wild birds can even be persuaded to sit on eggs made of\npainted wood. Why then, since they are so careless of appearances,\nshould the cuckoo go to all manner of trouble to match the eggs of\nhedgesparrow, robin or warbler? The bird would not notice the\ndifference, and, even if she did, she would probably sit quite as close,\nif only for the sake of the other eggs of her own laying. Once the ugly\nnestling is hatched, there comes swift awakening. Yet there is no\nthought of reprisal or desertion. It looks rather as if the little\nfoster-parents are hypnotised by the uncouth guest, for they see their\nown young ones elbowed out of the home and continue, with unflagging\ndevotion, to minister to the insatiable appetite of the greedy little\nmurderer. A bird so imbued as the parasitic cuckoo with the _Wanderlust_\nwould make a very careless parent, and we must therefore perhaps revise\nour unflattering estimate of its attitude and admit that it does the\nbest it can by its offspring in putting them out to nurse. This habit,\nunique among British birds, is practised by many others elsewhere, and\nin particular by the American troupials, or cattle-starlings. One of\nthese indeed goes even farther, since it entrusts its eggs to the care\nof a nest-building cousin. There are also American cuckoos that build\ntheir own nest and incubate their own eggs.\n\nOn the whole, our cuckoo is a friend to the farmer, for it destroys vast\nquantities of hairy caterpillars that no other bird, resident or\nmigratory, would touch. On the other hand, no doubt, the numbers of\nother small useful birds must suffer, not alone because the cuckoo sucks\ntheir eggs, but also because, as has been shown, the rearing of every\nyoung cuckoo means the destruction of the legitimate occupants of the\nnest. So far however as the farmer is concerned, this is probably\nbalanced by the reflection that a single young cuckoo is so rapacious as\nto need all the insect food available.\n\nThe cuckoo, like the woodcock, is supposed to have its forerunner. Just\nas the small horned owl, which reaches our shores a little in advance\nof the latter, is popularly known as the "woodcock owl," so also the\nwryneck, which comes to us about the same time as the first of the\ncuckoos, goes by the name of "cuckoo-leader." It is never a very\nconspicuous bird, and appears to be rarer nowadays than formerly.\nSchoolboys know it best from its habit of hissing like a snake and\ngiving them a rare fright when they cautiously insert a predatory hand\nin some hollow tree in search of a possible nest. It is in such\nsituations that, along with titmice and some other birds, the wryneck\nrears its young; and it doubtless owes many an escape to this habit of\nhissing, accompanied by a vigorous twisting of its neck and the\ninfliction of a sufficient peck, easily mistaken in a moment of panic\nfor the bite of an angry adder. Thus does Nature protect her weaklings.\n\n\n\n\nJUNE\n\nVOICES OF THE NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nVOICES OF THE NIGHT\n\n\nThe majority of nocturnal animals, more particularly those bent on\nspoliation, are strangely silent. True, frogs croak in the marshes, bats\nshrill overhead at so high a pitch that some folks cannot hear them, and\nowls hoot from their ruins in a fashion that some vote melodious and\nromantic, while others associate the sound rather with midnight crime\nand dislike it accordingly. The badger, on the other hand, with the\notter and fox--all of them sad thieves from our point of view--have\nlearnt, whatever their primeval habits, to go about their marauding in\nstealthy silence; and it is only in less settled regions that one hears\nthe jackals barking, the hyænas howling, and the browsing deer whistling\nthrough the night watches.\n\nThere are, however, two of our native birds, or rather summer visitors,\nsince they leave us in autumn, closely associated with these warm June\nnights, the stillness of which they break in very different fashion, and\nthese are the nightingale and nightjar. Each is of considerable\ninterest in its own way. It is not to be denied that the churring note\nof the nightjar is, to ordinary ears, the reverse of attractive, and the\nbird is not much more pleasing to the eye than to the ear; while the\nnightingale, on the contrary, produces such sweet sounds as made Izaak\nWalton marvel what music God could provide for His saints in heaven when\nHe gave such as this to sinners on earth. The suggestion was not wholly\nhis own, since the father of angling borrowed it from a French writer;\nbut he vastly improved on the original, and the passage will long live\nin the hearts of thousands who care not a jot for his instructions in\nrespect of worms. At the same time, the nightjar, though the less\nattractive bird of the two, is fully as interesting as its comrade of\nthe summer darkness, and there should be no difficulty in indicating the\nlittle that they have in common, as well as much wherein they differ, in\nboth habits and appearance.\n\nBoth, then, are birds of sober attire. Indeed of the two, the nightjar,\nwith its soft and delicately pencilled plumage and the conspicuous white\nspots, is perhaps the handsomer, though, as it is seen only in the\ngloaming, its quiet beauty is but little appreciated. The unobtrusive\ndress of the nightingale, on the other hand, is familiar in districts in\nwhich the bird abounds, and is commonly quoted, by contrast with its\nunrivalled voice, as the converse of the gaudy colouring of raucous\nmacaws and parrakeets. As has been said, both these birds are summer\nmigrants, the nightingale arriving on our shores about the middle of\nApril, the nightjar perhaps a fortnight later. Thenceforth, however,\ntheir programmes are wholly divergent, for, whereas the nightjars\nproceed to scatter over the length and breadth of Britain, penetrating\neven to Ireland in the west and as far north as the Hebrides, the\nnightingale stops far short of these extremes and leaves whole counties\nof England, as well as probably the whole of Scotland, and certainly the\nwhole of Ireland, out of its calculations. It is however well known that\nits range is slowly but surely extending towards the west.\n\nThis curiously restricted distribution of the nightingale, indeed,\nwithin the limits of its summer home is among the most remarkable of\nthe many problems confronting the student of distribution, and\nsuccessive ingenious but unconvincing attempts to explain its seeming\neccentricity, or at any rate caprice, in the choice of its nesting range\nonly make the confusion worse. Briefly, in spite of a number of doubtful\nand even suspicious reports of the bird\'s occurrence outside of these\nboundaries, it is generally agreed by the soundest observers that its\ntravels do not extend much north of the city of York, or much west of a\nline drawn through Exeter and Birmingham. By way of complicating the\nargument, we know, on good authority, that the nightingale\'s range is\nequally peculiar elsewhere; and that, whereas it likewise shuns the\ndepartments in the extreme west of France, it occurs all over the\nPeninsula, a region extending considerably farther into the sunset than\neither Brittany or Cornwall, in both of which it is unknown. No\nsatisfactory explanation of the little visitor\'s objection to Wild Wales\nor Cornwall has been found, and it may at once be stated that its\ncapricious distribution cannot be accounted for by any known facts of\nsoil, climate, or vegetation, since the surroundings which it finds\nsuitable in Kent and Sussex are equally to be found down in the West\nCountry, but fail to attract their share of nightingales.\n\nThe song of the nightingale, in praise of which volumes have been\nwritten, is perhaps more beautiful than that of any other bird, though I\nhave heard wonderful efforts from the mocking-bird in the United States\nand from the bulbuls along the banks of the Jordan. The latter are\nsometimes, more especially in poetry, regarded as identical with the\nnightingale; and, indeed, some ornithologists hold the two to be closely\nrelated. What a gap there is between the sobbing cadences of the\nnightingale and the rasping note of the nightjar, which, with specific\nreference to a Colonial cousin of that bird Tasmanians ingeniously\nrender as "more pork"! It seems almost ludicrous to include under the\nhead of birdsong not only the music of the nightingale, but also the\ncroak of the raven and the booming note of the ostrich. Yet these also\nare the love-songs of their kind, and the hen ostrich doubtless finds\nmore music in the thunderous note of her lord than in the faint melody\nof such song-birds as her native Africa provides. The nightingale sings\nto his mate while she is sitting on her olive-green eggs perching on a\nlow branch of the tree, at foot of which the slender nest is hidden in\nthe undergrowth. So much is known to every schoolboy who is too often\nguided by the sound on his errand of plunder; and why the song of this\nparticular warbler should have been described by so many writers as one\nof sadness, seeing that it is associated with the most joyous days in\nthe bird\'s year, passes comprehension. So obviously is its object to\nhearten the female in her long and patient vigil that as soon as the\nyoung are hatched the male\'s voice breaks like that of other choristers\nto a guttural croak. It is said, indeed--though so cruel an experiment\nwould not appeal to many--that if the nest be destroyed just as the\nyoung are hatched the bird recovers all his sweetness of voice and sings\nanew while another home is built.\n\nAlthough poetic licence has ascribed the song to the female, it is the\nmale nightingale only that sings, and for the purpose aforementioned.\nThe note of the nightjar, on the other hand, is equally uttered by both\nsexes, and both also have the curious habit of repeatedly clapping the\nwings for several minutes together. They moreover share the business of\nincubation, taking day and night duty on the eggs, which, two in number,\nare laid on the bare ground without any pretence of a nest, and\ngenerally on open commons in the neighbourhood of patches of fern-brake.\nLike the owls, these birds sleep during the day and are active only when\nthe sun goes down. It is this habit of seeking their insect food only in\nthe gloaming which makes nightjars among the most difficult of birds to\nstudy from life, and all accounts of their feeding habits must therefore\nbe received with caution, particularly that which compares the bristles\non the mouth with baleen in whales, serving as a sort of strainer for\nthe capture of minute flying prey. This is an interesting suggestion,\nand may even be sober fact; but its adoption would necessitate the bird\nflying open-mouthed among the oaks and other trees beneath which it\nfinds the yellow underwings and cockchafers on which it feeds, and I\nhave more than once watched it hunting its victims with the beak closed.\nI noticed this particularly when camping in the backwoods of Eastern\nCanada where the bird goes by the name of nighthawk.\n\nIn all probability its food consists exclusively of insects, though\nexceptional cases have been noted in which the young birds had evidently\nbeen fed on seeds. The popular error which charges it with stealing the\nmilk of ewes and goats, from which it derives the undeserved name of\n"goat-sucker," with its equivalent in several Continental languages, is\nanother result of the imperfect light in which it is commonly observed.\nNeedless to say, there is no truth whatever in the accusation, for the\nnightjar would find no more pleasure in drinking milk than we should in\neating moths.\n\nHere, then, are two night-voices of very different calibre. These are\nnot our only birds that break the silence on moonlight nights in June.\nThe common thrush often sings far into the night, and the sedge-warbler\nis a persistent caroller that has often been mistaken for the\nnightingale. The difference in this respect between the two subjects of\nthese remarks is that the nightjar is invariably silent all through the\nday, whereas the nightingale sings joyously at all hours. It is only\nbecause his splendid music is more marked in the comparative silence of\nthe night, with little or no competition, that his daylight concert is\noften overlooked.\n\n\n\n\nJULY\n\nSWIFTS, SWALLOWS AND MARTINS\n\n\n\n\nSWIFTS, SWALLOWS AND MARTINS\n\n\nWhen the trout-fisherman sees the first martins and swallows dipping\nover the sward of the water-meadows and skimming the surface of the\nstream in hot pursuit of such harried water-insects as have escaped the\njaws of greedy fish, he knows that summer is coming in. The signs of\nspring have been evident in the budding hedgerows for some weeks. The\nrooks are cawing in the elms, the cuckoo\'s note has been heard in the\nspinney for some time before these little visitors pass in jerky flight\nup and down the valley. Then, a little later, come the swifts--the black\nand screaming swifts--which, though learned folk may be right in\nsundering them utterly from their smaller travelling companions from the\nsunny south, will always in the popular fancy be associated with the\nrest. Colonies of swifts, swallows, and martins are a dominant feature\nof English village life during the warm months; and though there are\nfastidious folk who take not wholly culpable exception to their little\nvisitors on the score of cleanliness, most of us welcome them back each\nyear, if only for the sake of the glad season of their stay. If,\nmoreover, it is a question of choice between these untiring travellers\nresting in our eaves and the stay-at-home starling or sparrow, the\nchoice will surely fall on the first every time.\n\nThe swift is the largest and most rapid in its flight, and its voice has\na penetrating quality lacking in the notes of the rest. Swifts screaming\nin headlong flight about a belfry or up and down a country lane are the\nembodiment of that sheer joy of life which, in some cases with slender\nreason, we associate peculiarly with the bird-world. Probably, however,\nthese summer migrants are as happy as most of their class. On the wing\nthey can have few natural enemies, though one may now and again be\nstruck down by a hawk; and they alight on the ground so rarely as to run\nlittle risk from cats or weasels, while the structure and position of\ntheir nests alike afford effectual protection for the eggs and young.\nCompared with that of the majority of small birds, therefore, their\nexistence should be singularly happy and free from care; and though\nthat of the swift can scarcely, perhaps, when we remember its shrill\nvoice, be described as one grand sweet song, it should not be chequered\nby many troubles. The greatest risk is no doubt that of being snapped up\nby some watchful pike if the bird skims too close to the surface of\neither still or running water, and I have even heard of their being\nseized in this way by hungry mahseer, those great barbel which gladden\nthe heart of exiled anglers whose lot is cast on the banks of Himalayan\nrivers.\n\nIt is, however, the sparrows and starlings, rivals for the nesting\nsites, who show themselves the irreconcilable enemies of the returned\nprodigals. Terrific battles are continually enacted between them with\nvarying fortunes, and the anecdotes of these frays would fill a volume.\nJesse tells of a feud at Hampton Court, in the course of which the\nswallows, having only then completed their nest, were evicted by\nsparrows, who forthwith took possession and hatched out their eggs. Then\ncame Nemesis, for the sparrows were compelled to go foraging for food\nwith which to fill the greedy beaks, and during their enforced absence\nthe swallows returned in force, threw the nestlings out, and demolished\nthe home. The sparrows sought other quarters, and the swallows\ntriumphantly built a new nest on the ruins of the old. A German writer\nrelates a case of revolting reprisal on the part of some swallows\nagainst a sparrow that appropriated their nest and refused to quit.\nAfter repeated failure to evict the intruder, the swallows, helped by\nother members of the colony, calmly plastered up the front door so\neffectually that the unfortunate sparrow was walled up alive and died of\nhunger. This refined mode of torture is not unknown in the history of\nmankind, but seems singularly unsuited to creatures so fragile.\n\nThe nests of these birds show, as a rule, little departure from the\nconventional plan, but they do adapt their architecture to\ncircumstances, and I remember being much struck on one occasion by the\nabsence of any dome or roof. It was in Asia Minor, on the seashore, that\nI came upon a cottage long deserted, its door hanging by one hinge, and\nall the glass gone from the windows. In the empty rooms numerous\nswallows were rearing twittering broods in roofless nests. No doubt the\nbirds realised that they had nothing to fear from rain, and were\nreluctant to waste time and labour in covering their homes with\nunnecessary roofs.\n\nMost birds are careful in the education of their young, and indeed\nthorough training at an early stage must be essential in the case of\ncreatures that are left to protect themselves and to find their own food\nwhen only a few weeks old. Fortunately they develop with a rapidity that\nputs man and other mammals to shame, and the helpless bald little swift\nlying agape in the nest will in another fortnight be able to fly across\nEurope. One of the most favoured observers of the early teaching given\nby the mother-swallow to her brood was an angler who told me how, one\nevening when he was fishing in some ponds at no great distance from\nLondon, a number of baby swallows alighted on his rod. He kept as still\nas possible, fearful of alarming his interesting visitors, but he must\nat last have moved, for, with one accord, they all fell off his rod\ntogether, skimmed over the surface of the water and disappeared in the\ndirection from which they had come a few moments earlier.\n\nSwifts fly to an immense height these July evenings, mounting to such an\naltitude as eventually to disappear out of sight altogether. This\ncurious habit, which is but imperfectly understood, has led to the\nbelief that, instead of roosting in the nest or among the reeds like the\nswallows, the males, at any rate, spend the night flying about under the\nstars. This fantastic notion is not, however, likely to commend itself\nto those who pause to reflect on the incessant activity displayed by\nthese birds the livelong day. So rarely indeed do they alight that\ncountry folk gravely deny them the possession of feet, and it is in the\nlast degree improbable that a bird of such feverish alertness could\ndispense with its night\'s rest. No one who has watched swifts, swallows\nand martins on the wing can fail to be struck by the extraordinary\njudgment with which these untiring birds seem to shave the arches of\nbridges, gateposts, and other obstacles in the way of their flight by so\nnarrow a margin as continually to give the impression of catastrophe\nimminent and inevitable. Their escapes from collision are marvellous;\nbut the birds are not infallible, as is shown by the untoward fate of a\nswallow in Sussex. In an old garden in that county there had for many\nyears been an open doorway with no door, and through the open space the\nswallows had been wont, year after year, to fly to and fro on their\nhunting trips. Then came a fateful winter during which a new owner took\nit into his head to put up a fresh gate and to keep it locked, and, as\nill luck would have it, he painted it blue, which, in the season of fine\nweather, probably heightened the illusion. Back came the happy swallows\nto their old playground, and one of the pioneers flew headlong at the\nclosed gate and fell stunned and dying on the ground, a minor tragedy\nthat may possibly come as a surprise to those who regard the instincts\nof wild birds as unerring.\n\nThat the young swallows leave our shores before their elders--late in\nAugust or early in September--is an established fact, and the instinct\nwhich guides them aright over land and sea, without assistance from\nthose more experienced, is nothing short of amazing. The swifts, last\nto come, are also first to go, spending less time in the land of their\nbirth than either swallows or martins. The fact that an occasional\nswallow has been seen in this country during the winter months finds\nexpression in the adage that "one swallow does not make a summer," and\nit was no doubt this occasional apparition that in a less enlightened\nage seemed to warrant the extraordinary belief, which still ekes out a\nprecarious existence in misinformed circles, that these birds, instead\nof wintering abroad, retire in a torpid condition to the bottom of lakes\nand ponds. It cannot be denied that these waters have occasionally, when\ndredged or drained, yielded a stray skeleton of a swallow, but it should\nbe evident to the most homely intelligence that such débris merely\nindicates careless individuals that, in passing over the water, got\ntheir plumage waterlogged and were then drowned. It seems strange that\nGilbert White, so accurate an observer of birds, should actually have\ntoyed with this curious belief, though he leant rather to the more\nreasonable version of occasional hybernation in caves or other\nsheltered hiding-places. The rustic mind, however, preferred, and in\nsome unsophisticated districts still prefers, the ancient belief in\ndiving swallows, and no weight of evidence, however carefully presented,\nwould shake it in its creed. Fortunately this eccentric view of the\nswallow\'s habits brings no harm to the bird itself, and may thus be\ntolerated as an innocuous indulgence on the part of those who prefer\nthis fiction to the even stranger truth.\n\n\n\n\nAUGUST\n\nTHE SEAGULL\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEAGULL\n\n\nSo glorious is the flight of the seagull that it tempts us to fling\naside the dry-as-dust theories of mechanism of flexed wings, coefficient\nof air resistance, and all the abracadabra of the mathematical\nbiologist, and just to give thanks for a sight so inspiring as that of\ngulls ringing high in the eye of the wind over hissing combers that\nbreak on sloping beaches or around jagged rocks. These birds are one\nwith the sea, knowing no fear of that protean monster which, since\nearth\'s beginning, has always, with its unfathomable mystery, its\ninsatiable cruelty, its tremendous strength, been a source of terror to\nthe land animals that dwell in sight of it. Yet the gulls sit on the\ncurling rollers as much at their ease as swimmers in a pond, and give an\nimpression of unconscious courage very remarkable in creatures that seem\nso frail. Hunger may drive them inland, or instincts equally\nirresistible at the breeding season, but never the worst gale that\nlashes the sea to fury, for they dread it in its hour of rage as little\nas on still summer nights when, in their hundreds, they fly off the land\nto roost on the water outside the headlands.\n\nIt is curious that there should be no mention of them in the sacred\nwritings. We read of quails coming in from the sea, likewise of "four\ngreat beasts," but of seafowl never a word, though one sees them in\nabundance on the coast near Jaffa, and the Hebrew writers might have\nbeen expected to weave them into the rich fabrics of their poetic\nimagery as they did the pelican, the eagle and other birds less\nfamiliar. Although seagulls have of late years been increasingly in\nevidence beside the bridges of London, they are still, to the majority\nof folk living far inland, symbolical of the August holiday at the\ncoast, and their splendid flight and raucous cries are among the most\nenduring memories of that yearly escape from the smoke of cities.\n\nThe voice of gulls can with difficulty be regarded as musical, yet those\nof us who live the year round by the sea find their plaintive mewing as\nnicely tuned to that wild environment as the amorous gurgling of\nnightingales to moonlit woods in May. Their voice may have no great\nrange, but at any rate it is not lacking in variety, suggesting to the\nplayful imagination laughter, tears, and other human moods to which they\nare in all probability strangers. The curious similarity between the\nnote of a seagull and the whining of a cat bereft of her kittens is very\nstriking, and was on one occasion the cause of my being taken in by one\nof these birds in a deep and beautiful backwater of the Sea of Marmora,\nbeside which I spent one pleasant summer. In this particular gulf, at\nthe head of which stands the ancient town of Ismidt, gulls, though\nplentiful in the open sea, are rarely in evidence, being replaced by\nherons and pelicans. I had not therefore set eyes on a seagull for many\nweeks, when early one morning I heard, from the farther side of a wooded\nheadland, a new note suggestive of a wild cat or possibly a lynx. My\nGreek servant tried in his patois to explain the unseen owner of the\nmysterious voice, but it was only when a small gull suddenly came\npaddling round the corner that I realised my mistake.\n\nIn addition to being at home on the seashore, and particularly in\nestuaries and where the coast is rocky, gulls are a familiar sight in\nthe wake of steamers at the beginning and ending of the voyage, as well\nas following the plough and nesting in the vicinity of inland meres and\nmarshes. The black-headed kind is peculiarly given to bringing up its\nfamily far from the sea, just as the salmon ascends our rivers for the\nsame purpose. It is not perhaps a very loving parent, seeing that the\nmortality among young gulls, many of which show signs of rough treatment\nby their elders, is unusually great. On most lakes rich in fish these\nbirds have long established themselves, and they were, I remember, as\nfamiliar at Geneva and Neuchâtel as along the shores of Lake Tahoe in\nthe Californian Sierras, itself two hundred miles from the Pacific and\nmore than a mile above sea-level. Gulls also follow the plough in\nhordes, not always to the complete satisfaction of the farmer, who is,\nnot unreasonably, sceptical when told that they seek wireworms only and\nhave no taste for grain. Unfortunately the ordinary scarecrow has no\nterror for them, and I recollect, in the neighbourhood of Maryport,\nseeing an immense number of gulls turning up the soil in close proximity\nto several crows that, dangling from gibbets, effectually kept all black\nmarauders away.\n\nYoung gulls are, to the careless eye, apt to look larger than their\nparents, an illusion possibly due to the optical effect of their dappled\nplumage, and few people unfamiliar with these birds in their succeeding\nmoults readily believe that the dark birds are younger than the white.\nDown in little Cornish harbours I have sometimes watched these young\nbirds turned to good account by their lazy elders, who call them to the\nfeast whenever the ebbing tide uncovers a heap of dead pilchards lying\nin three or four feet of water, and then pounce on them the moment they\ncome to the surface with their booty. The fact is that gulls are not\nexpert divers. The cormorant and puffin and guillemot can vanish at the\nflash of a gun, reappearing far from where they were last seen, and can\npursue and catch some of the swiftest fishes under water. Some gulls,\nhowever, are able to plunge farther below the surface than others, and\nthe little kittiwake is perhaps the most expert diver of them all,\nthough in no sense at home under water like the shag. I have often, when\nat anchor ten or fifteen miles from the land, and attended by the usual\nconvoy of seabirds that invariably gather round fishing-boats, amused\nmyself by throwing scraps of fish to them and watching the gulls do\ntheir best to plunge below the surface when some coveted morsel was\ngoing down into the depths, and now and again a little Roman-nose puffin\nwould dive headlong and snatch the prize from under the gulls\' eyes.\nMost of the birds were fearless enough; only an occasional\n"saddleback"--the greater black-backed gull of the text-books--knowing\nthe hand of man to be against it for its raids on game and poultry,\nwould keep at a respectful distance.\n\nConsidered economically, the smaller gulls at any rate have more friends\nthan enemies, and they owe most of the latter not so much to their\nappetites, which set more store by offal and carrion than by anything of\ngreater value, as to their exceedingly dirty habits. These unclean fowl\nare in fact anything but welcome in harbours given over in summer to\nsmart yachting craft; and I remember how at Avalon, the port of Santa\nCatalina Island (Cal.), various devices were employed to prevent them\nalighting. Boats at their moorings were festooned with strips of\nbunting, which apparently had the requisite effect, and the railings of\nthe club were protected by a formidable armour of nails. On the credit\nside of their account with ourselves, seagulls are admittedly assiduous\nscavengers, and their services in keeping little tidal harbours clear of\ndecaying fish which, if left to accumulate, would speedily breed a\npestilence, cannot well be overrated. The fishermen, though they rarely\nmolest them, do not always refer to the birds with the gratitude that\nmight be expected, yet they are still further in their debt, being often\napprised by their movement of the whereabouts of mackerel and pilchard\nshoals, and, in thick weather, getting many a friendly warning of the\nwhereabouts of outlying rocks from the hoarse cries of the gulls that\nhave their haunts on these menaces to inshore navigation.\n\nSeagulls are not commonly made pets of, the nearest approach to such\nadoption being an occasional pinioned individual enjoying qualified\nliberty in a backyard. Their want of popularity is easily understood,\nsince they lack the music of the canary and the mimicry of parrots. That\nthey are, however, capable of appreciating kindness has been\ndemonstrated by many anecdotes. The Rev. H. A. Macpherson used to tell a\nstory of how a young gull, found with a broken wing by the children of\nsome Milovaig crofters, was nursed back to health by them until it\neventually flew away. Not long after it had gone, one of the children\nwas lost on the hillside, and the gull, flying overhead, recognised one\nof its old playmates and hovered so as to attract the attention of the\nchild. Then, on being called, the bird settled and roosted on the ground\nbeside him. An even more remarkable story is told of a gull taken from\nthe nest, on the coast of county Cork, and brought up by hand until, in\nthe following spring, it flew away in the company of some others of its\nkind that passed over the garden in which it had its liberty. The bird\'s\nowner reasonably concluded that he had seen the last of his protégée,\nand great was his astonishment when, in the first October gale, not\nonly did the visitor return, tapping at the dining-room window for\nadmission, as it had always done, but actually brought with it a young\ngull, and the two paid him a visit every autumn for a number of years.\n\nOn either side of the gulls, and closely associated with them in habits\nand in structure, is a group of birds equally characteristic of the open\ncoast, the skuas and terns. The skuas, darker and more courageous birds,\nare familiar to those who spend their August holiday sea-fishing near\nthe Land\'s End, where, particularly on days when the east wind brings\nthe gannets and porpoises close inshore, the great skua may be seen at\nits favourite game of swooping on the gulls and making them disgorge or\ndrop their launce or pilchard, which the bird usually retrieves before\nit reaches the water. This act of piracy has earned for the skua its\nWest Country sobriquet of "Jack Harry," and against so fierce an\nonslaught even the largest gull, though actually of heavier build than\nits tyrant, has no chance and seldom indeed seems to offer the feeblest\nresistance. These skuas rob their neighbours in every latitude; and\neven in the Antarctic one kind, closely related to our own, makes havoc\namong the penguins, an episode described by the late Dr. Wilson, one of\nthe heroes of the ill-fated Scott expedition.\n\nFar more pleasing to the eye are the graceful little terns, or\n"sea-swallows," fairylike creatures with red legs and bill, long pointed\nwings and deeply forked tail, which skim the surface of the sea or hawk\nover the shallows of trout streams in search of dragonflies or small\nfish. It is not a very rare experience for the trout-fisherman to hook a\nswallow which may happen to dash by at the moment of casting; but a much\nmore unusual occurrence was that of a tern, on a well-known pool of the\nSpey, actually mistaking a salmon-fly for a small fish and swooping on\nit, only to get firmly hooked by the bill. Fortunately for the too\nventuresome tern the fisherman was a lover of birds, and he managed with\nsome difficulty to reel it in gently, after which it was released none\nthe worse for its mistake.\n\n\n\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nBIRDS IN THE CORN\n\n\n\n\nBIRDS IN THE CORN\n\n\nMore than one of our summer visitors, like the nightingale and cuckoo,\nare less often seen than heard, but certainly the most secretive hider\nof them all is the landrail. This harsh-voiced bird reaches our shores\nin May, and it was on the last of that month that I lately heard its\nrasping note in a quiet park not a mile out of a busy market town on the\nWelsh border, and forgave its monotone because, more emphatically than\neven the cuckoo\'s dissyllable, it announced that, at last, "summer was\nicumen in." This feeble-looking but indomitable traveller is closely\nassociated during its visit with the resident partridge. They nest in\nthe same situations, hiding in the fields of grass and standing corn,\nand eventually being flushed in company by September guns walking\nabreast through the clover-bud. Sport is not the theme of these notes,\nand it will therefore suffice to remark in passing on the curious manner\nin which even good shots, accustomed to bring down partridges with some\napproach to certainty, contrive to miss these lazy, flapping fowl when\nwalking them up. Dispassionately considered, the landrail should be a\nbird that a man could scarcely miss on the first occasion of his\nhandling a gun; in cold fact, it often survives two barrels apparently\nuntouched. This immunity it owes in all probability to its slow and\nheavy flight, since those whose eyes are accustomed to the rapid\nmovement of partridges are apt to misjudge the allowance necessary for\nsuch a laggard and to fire in front of it. It is difficult to realise\nthat, whereas the strong-winged partridge is a stay-at-home, the\ndeliberate landrail has come to us from Africa and will, if spared by\nthe guns, return there.\n\nPerhaps the most curious and interesting habit recorded of the landrail\nis that of feigning death when suddenly discovered, a method of\nself-defence which it shares with opossums, spiders, and in fact other\nanimals of almost every class. It will, if suddenly surprised by a dog,\nlie perfectly still and betray no sign of life. There is, however, at\nleast one authentic case of a landrail actually dying of fright when\nsuddenly seized, and it is a disputed point whether the so-called\npretence of death should not rather be regarded as a state of trance.\nStrict regard for the truth compels the admission that on the only\noccasion on which I remember taking hold of a live corncrake the bird,\nso far from pretending to be dead, pecked my wrist heartily.\n\nJust as the countryfolk regard the wryneck as leader of the wandering\ncuckoos, and the short-eared owl as forerunner of the woodcocks, so the\nancients held that the landrail performed the same service of pioneer to\nthe quail on its long journeys over land and sea. Save in exceptional\nyears, England is not visited by quail in sufficient numbers to lend\ninterest to this aspect of a bird attractive on other grounds, but the\ncoincidence of their arrival with us is well established.\n\nThe voice of the corncrake, easily distinguished from that of any other\nbird of our fields, may be approximately reproduced by using a blunt saw\nagainst the grain on hard wood. So loud is it at times that I have heard\nit from the open window of an express train, the noise of which drowned\nall other birdsong, and it seems remarkable that such a volume of sound\nshould come from a throat so slender. Yet the rasping note is welcome\nduring the early days of its arrival, since, just as the cuckoo gave\nearlier message of spring, so the corncrake, in sadder vein, heralds the\nripeness of our briefer summer.\n\nThe East Anglian name "dakker-hen" comes from an old word descriptive of\nthe bird\'s halting flight; and indeed to see a landrail drop, as already\nmentioned, after flying a few yards, makes one incredulous when tracing\nits long voyages on the map. In the first place, however, it should be\nremembered that the bird does not drop back in the grass because it is\ntired, but solely because it knows the way to safety by running out of\nsight. In the second, the apparent weakness of its wings is not real.\nQuails have little round wings that look ill adapted to long journeys. I\nhave been struck by this times and again when shooting quail in Egypt\nand Morocco, yet of the quail\'s fitness for travel there has never,\nsince Bible days, been any question.\n\nThe landrail is an excellent table bird. Personally I prefer it to the\npartridge, but this is perhaps praising it too highly. Legally of\ncourse it is "game," as a game licence must be held by anyone who shoots\nit; and, though protected in this country only under the Wild Birds Act,\nIrish law extends this by a month, so that it may not be shot in that\ncountry after the last day of January. Like most migratory birds, its\nnumbers vary locally in different seasons, and its scarcity in\nHampshire, to which White makes reference, has by no means been\nmaintained of recent years, as large bags have been recorded in every\npart of that county.\n\nThe common partridge is--at any rate for the naturalist--a less\ninteresting subject than its red-legged cousin, which seems to have been\nfirst introduced from France (or possibly from the island of Guernsey,\nwhere it no longer exists) in the reign of Charles II. That this early\nexperiment was not, however, attended by far-reaching results seems\nprobable, since early in the reign of George III we find the Marquis of\nHertford and other well-known sporting landowners making fresh attempts,\nthe stock of "Frenchmen" being renewed from time to time during the\nnext fifty years, chiefly on the east side of England, where they have\nalways been more in evidence than farther west. In Devon and Cornwall,\nindeed, the bird is very rare, and in Ireland almost unknown.\n\nIts red legs stand it in good stead, for it can run like a hare, and in\nthis way it often baffles the guns. It is not, however, so much its\nreluctance to rise that has brought it into disrepute with keepers as\nits alleged habit of ousting the native bird, in much the same way as\nthe "Hanover" rat has superseded the black aboriginal, although far from\nthe "Frenchman" driving the English partridge off the soil, there\nappears to be even no truth in the supposed hostility between the two,\nsince they do not commonly affect the same type of country; and even\nwhen they meet they nest in close proximity and in comparative harmony.\nNevertheless the males, even of the same species, are apt to be\npugnacious in the breeding season.\n\nBoth the partridge and landrail run serious risk from scythe and plough\nwhile sitting on the nest. Landrails have before now been decapitated by\nthe swing of the scythe, and a case is on record in which a sitting\npartridge, seeing that the plough was coming dangerously near her nest,\nactually removed the whole clutch of eggs, numbering over a score, to\nthe shelter of a neighbouring hedge. This was accomplished, probably\nwith the help of the male, during the short time it took the plough to\nget to the end of the field and back, and is a remarkable illustration\nof devotion and ingenuity. Not for nothing indeed is the partridge a\ngame bird, for it has been seen to attack cats, and even foxes, in\ndefence of the covey; and I have seen, in the MS. notes of the second\nEarl of Malmesbury, preserved in the library at Heron Court, mention of\none that drove off a carrion crow that menaced the family. Both\npartridge and landrail sit very close, particularly when the time of\nhatching is near, and Charles St. John saw a partridge, which his dog,\nhaving taken off the nest, was forced to drop, none the worse for her\nadventure, go straight back to her duties; though, as he adds, if it had\nnot been that she knew that the eggs were already chipping she would in\nall probability have deserted her post for good and all.\n\nWhether or not France is to be regarded as the original home of the "red\nleg," the fact remains that in that country it is becoming scarcer every\nyear, its numbers being maintained only in Brittany, Calvados, Orne, and\nSarthe. Its distribution in Italy is equally capricious, for it is\nvirtually restricted to the rocky slopes of the Apennines, the\nVolterrano Hills in Tuscany, and the coast ranges of Elba. It seems\ntherefore that in Continental countries, as well as with us, the bird\nextends its range reluctantly. Game-preservers seem, however, to agree\nthat partridges and pheasants are, beyond a certain point, incompatible\nas, with a limited supply of natural food, the smaller bird goes to the\nwall. Like most birds, partridges grow bold when pressed by cold and\nhunger, and I recollect hearing of a large covey being encountered ten\nor twelve years ago in an open space in the heart of the city of\nFrankfort.\n\n\n\n\nOCTOBER\n\nTHE MOPING OWL\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOPING OWL\n\n\nMusic, vocal or otherwise, is always a matter of taste, and individual\nappreciation of birdsong varies like the rest. One man finds the\ncuckoo\'s cry intolerably wearisome. Another sees no romance in the\ngargling of doves, while comparatively few care for the piercing scream\nof the starling or the rasping note of the corncrake. Yet few birds\nperform to a more hostile audience than the owl. I say advisedly "the\nowl," since the vast majority of people make no distinction whatever\nbetween our three resident kinds of owl, not to mention at least half a\ndozen more visitors. Some excuse for such carelessness might perhaps be\nfound in the similar flight and habits of different owls, but it might\nhave been thought that greater measure of individual recognition on\ntheir own merits would have been conceded to birds that range in size\nfrom the dimensions of a sparrow to those of a duck. But no; an owl is\njust an owl. Why the soft and haunting cry of these birds should not\nmerely displease, but actually alarm, so many people unaccustomed to\nsuch sounds of the gloaming and darkness it would be difficult to say;\nbut the voice of owls may possibly owe some of its disturbing effect to\ncontrast with their silent flight, which, thanks to their fluffy\nplumage, with its broad quills and long barbs, prevents their making\nmuch more noise than ghosts when hunting rats and mice in moonlit\nfields. Only one other English bird has so quiet a flight, and that is\nthe nightjar, another creature of the darkness, which, though no cousin\nto these nocturnal birds of prey, is known in some parts of the country\nas the "fern-owl." Visitors unprepared for the eerie woodland music of\nthese autumn nights shudder when they hear the cry of the owl, as if it\nsuggested midnight crime. For myself I have more agreeable associations,\nsince I never hear one of these birds without recalling a gallant fight\nI once had with a big Tweed salmon in the weak light of a young moon,\nwhile three owls hooted amid the ghostly ruins of Norham Castle. Yet,\neven apart from this wholly agreeable memory, I find nothing unpleasant\nin their music, and can readily conceive that the moping owl may sing to\nhis mate as passionately as Philomel.\n\nNot only is there the popular lack of distinction between one owl and\nanother already referred to, but scientific ornithologists have\ndisplayed similar want of finality in classifying these birds. There are\n(as in seals) eared and earless owls, though the so-called "ears" in the\nbirds are not actually ears at all, but tufts of feathers that give\nrather the impression of horns. There are bare-legged owls and owls with\nfeather stockings. There are owls that fly by day and owls that fly by\nnight, though this is a less satisfactory distinction than that between\nthe diurnal butterflies and nocturnal moths. Any reliable classification\nof owls must, in short, rest on certain structural bony differences of\ninterest only to the student of anatomy. Nearly all these birds are able\nto turn the outer toe completely round, and most of them, also, have\nvery keen hearing, which must be an invaluable aid when hunting small\nanimals in the dark.\n\nDid the ancients actually regard the owl as a wise bird, or was the\nfashion of depicting it in the following of Minerva merely dictated by\nthe presence of these birds on the Akropolis? It seems hardly\nconceivable that they could so have blundered as to call the owls that\nwe know clever birds; and the alternative assumption that owlish\nintellect can have appreciably changed in the interval is even less\nacceptable. It is probable that too much significance need not be\nattached to such association between the Greek goddess of wisdom and her\nattendant owls, for Hindu symbolism represented Ganesa, god of wisdom,\nwith the head of an elephant, yet that animal, which the natives of\nIndia know better than the men of any other race, has never figured in\ntheir folklore as a type noted for its cunning. About the owl as we know\nit to-day, with its spectacled face and blinking eyes, there is nothing\nstrikingly intelligent, and schoolboy slang, in which the word does duty\nas synonymous with foolishness, discovers a more accurate appreciation\nof these birds.\n\nSeen at its worst, when surprised in the glare of daylight and mobbed by\na furious rabble of little birds, an owl looks a helpless fool indeed,\nthough this is not the proper moment to judge of the bird\'s\npossibilities under happier circumstances. Why these small fowl should\nbully it at all is one of those woodland problems that no one has yet\nsolved. The first, and obvious, explanation is that they know it for\ntheir enemy, and it may be indeed that owls commit depredations on the\nnests of wild birds of which we, who academically regard their food as\nconsisting of rats, bats and mice--or, in the case of larger species, of\nyoung game and leverets--have no inkling. If however such is the case,\nit is strange that the habit should have been overlooked by those who\nhave paid close attention to this curious and interesting group.\nBird-catchers, at any rate, without troubling to inquire into the\nreason, turn the instinct to profitable account, and in some parts of\nthe country a stuffed owl is an important item of their stock-in-trade.\n\nThe majority of owls that either reside in or visit these islands are\nbenefactors of the farmer, and should be spared. The larger eagle-owl,\nand snowy owl eat more expensive food, though, seeing that they come to\nus--at any rate in the south country--only in winter, and even then\nirregularly, they can do no damage to young game birds, and are probably\nincapable of capturing old. The worst offender among the residents is\nthe tawny owl, to which I find the following reference in the famous\nMalmesbury MSS.: "Common here ... a great destroyer of young game and\nleverets ... they sit in ivy bushes during the day, and I have known one\nremain, altho\' its mate was killed, in the same tree, in such a state of\ntorpor did it appear to be...." The screech owl is a harmless bird and a\nterror to mice, and any doubt as to its claim on the farmer\'s\nhospitality would at once be removed by cursory examination of the\nundigested pellets which, in common with hawks, these birds cast up\nafter their meals.\n\nOn the other hand, there is sometimes good reason for modifying any plea\nfor kindness to owls. Handsome is as handsome does, and many of these\nbirds are, during the nesting season, not only savage in defence of\ntheir young, but actually so aggressive as to make unprovoked attack on\nall and sundry who unwittingly approach closer to the tree than these\ndevoted householders think desirable. Accounts of this troublesome mood\nin nesting owls come from several parts of the country, and notably from\nWales. In one case on record a pair of barn owls had their home in a\ntree overlooking Milford Haven, and the vicinity of the nest soon became\ndangerous. The male owl tore a boy\'s ear, knocked a man down, and\nattacked numerous human beings and dogs that made use of a path leading\npast the tree; and these episodes were in fact of daily occurrence until\nsome one shot the bird. Another pair of barn owls nested in a wood on\nthe shore of Menai Strait, and in this case the young birds managed to\nfall out of the nest, and lay on the ground in full view of a public\nright of way. Why the old birds did not put their offspring back in the\nnest no one knew. Possibly they realised that the talons, which so\nefficiently gripped rats, might not prove gentle enough for the\ntransport of owlets. At any rate, whatever their reason, they left the\nyoung birds on the ground, feeding them in that position, and flew at\neveryone who passed that way, clawing face and ears, and eventually\nestablishing a reign of terror. Another owl behaved in somewhat similar\nfashion in a spinney close to Axmouth, South Devon, punishing a\ncoastguard so severely that the man took to his heels. Such determined\ntactics in defence of the young are the more singular when we remember\nthat owls are, in normal circumstances, shy and retiring birds. Yet they\noccasionally seem to be possessed by more sociable instincts, in proof\nof which one of the long-eared kind has been seen feeding in the company\nof tame hawks; a pair of owls once nested in a dovecote close to a\nkeeper\'s lodge in the Highlands; and wild owls have been known to pay\nnightly visits to a cage in the Botanic Gardens at Launceston\n(Tasmania), in order to bring food to their captive friends.\n\nEven apart from these rigorous measures of defence, the nesting habits\nof owls are not without interest. The majority lay their eggs in either\nhollow trees or ruins, and it is worth remark that these nocturnal\nbirds bring up their young in darkness, whereas the hawks--birds of\ndaylight--rear theirs in open nests, high up in trees or on rocky\nledges, in the full glare of the sun. One owl indeed habitually burrows\nin the prairies and pampas, in the curious company of marmots and\nrattlesnakes, and this burrowing habit is also, in some parts of the\nUnited States, adopted by the common barn owl. Owls generally brood from\nthe laying of the first egg, with the obvious result that young birds in\nvarious stages of plumage are found together in the nest. It has been\nsuggested that the body of the first to leave the egg helps to keep the\nunhatched eggs warm while the parents are away foraging, else its\npresence would be a serious handicap. The first little owl to hatch out\nis usually ready to leave the nest soon after the arrival of the last,\nthough these chicks come into the world more helpless even than the\nmajority of birds.\n\n\n\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nWATERFOWL\n\n\n\n\nWATERFOWL\n\n\nHad these notes been written from the standpoint of sport, the three\nfamiliar groups of birds, which together make up this world-wide aquatic\nfamily, might better have borne their alternative title "wildfowl" with\nits covert sneer at the hand-reared pheasant and artificially encouraged\npartridge that, between them, furnish so much comfortable sport to those\nwith no fancy for the arduous business of the mudflats. It is true that,\nof late years, the mallard has, in experienced hands, made a welcome\naddition to the bag in covert shooting, as those will remember who have\nshot the Lockwood Beat on the last day of the shoot at Nuneham; and\nthere is historic evidence of "wild" duck having been reared for\npurposes of sport with hawks in the reign of Charles I. Yet such\narmchair shooting of wildfowl was ignored by Colonel Hawker and the\nsecond Earl of Malmesbury, both of whom, gunning in the creeks and\nestuaries of the south coast, made immense bags of ducks and geese,\nworking hard for every bird and displaying Spartan indifference to the\nrigours of wintry weather. To hardy sportsmen of their type, wildfowl\noffer red-letter days with punt or shoulder guns, not to be dreamt of\nunder the ægis of the gamekeeper.\n\nIn this country, at any rate, we associate the V-shaped companies of\nwigeon and gaggles of geese with an ice-bound landscape, though in\nexceptional years, even where they no longer stay to breed, these\nnight-flying northerners linger to the coming of spring, and Hawker\nnoticed the curious apparition of grey geese and swallows in company on\nthe first day of April, 1839. This wedge formation of flight over land\nand sea is not only peculiar to these waterfowl, but is not apparently\nadopted by any other long distance migrants. No satisfactory explanation\nof their preference for flying in this order has been found, but it is\nthought to lessen the air resistance, which must be a consideration for\nthese short-pinioned fowl that weigh heavy in proportion to their\ndisplacement and at the same time lack the tremendous spread of wing\nthat enables the wandering albatross to soar for days together over the\nillimitable ocean. With one noticeable exception, these waterfowl\nexhibit a more extraordinary range of size and weight than any other\nfamily of birds, from the whooper swan, five feet long and twenty-five\npounds on the scales, down to the little teal, with an overall\nmeasurement of only fourteen inches and a weight that does not exceed as\nmany ounces. The only other family of birds running to such extremes is\nthat of the birds of prey, which include at once the stately condor of\nthe Andes with its wing-spread of fifteen feet, and the miniature\nred-legged falconet of India and adjoining countries, in which the same\nmeasurement would scarcely reach as many inches.\n\nSince even game birds are derisively referred to as "tame" only by those\nignorant of the facts, the birds now under notice differ in this respect\nfrom all those previously dealt with; and they are geographically apart,\nagain, from our other domesticated animals, since they are not, like the\nbarndoor fowl and most of the rest, of Asiatic origin, but must often,\nin the grey of a winter morning, be conscious of their near relations\nflying at liberty across the sky. The geese and ducks have been\nremarkably transformed by the process of domestication, and a comparison\nbetween those of the farmyard and their kindred in the marshes should\nillustrate not only the relative value of most virtues, but also the\nall-importance of Aristotle\'s how, when and where. Strictly speaking, no\ndoubt, the tame birds have degenerated, both mentally and physically, as\nsurely as the tame ass. They have lost the acute perceptions and swift\nflight of their wild relations. Economically, on the other hand, they\nare immeasurably improved, since the farmer, indifferent to the more\ninspiring personality of the grey goose and the mallard, merely wants\nhis poultry to be greedy and stupid, fattening themselves incessantly\nfor Leadenhall and easily captured when required.\n\nBetween swans, geese and ducks there is little anatomical difference,\nsave in the matter of size. The swans are the giants of the race, and\nthe swans of three continents are white. It was left for Australia, land\nof topsy-turveydom, to produce a black swan (I spare the reader the\nobvious classical tag), and this remarkable bird, first observed by\nEuropeans in the early days of 1697, was quickly brought to Europe and\nfigures in the earliest list of animals shown in the London Zoological\nGardens. All these birds have a curious trick of hissing when angry, and\nthis habit, perhaps because it is usually accompanied by a deliberate\nstretching of the neck to its full length, is seriously regarded by some\nas conscious mimicry of snakes, a proposition that must be left to\nindividual taste, but that strikes me as somewhat far-fetched. At any\nrate, it gives to these birds a formidable air, and, though the current\nbelief in its power of breaking a man\'s arm with a blow from its wing is\nprobably unwarranted, an angry swan, disturbed on its nest, is an\nawesome apparition of which I have twice taken hurried leave. On the\nfirst occasion, I had nothing but a valuable camera with me, and it was,\nin fact, after a futile attempt to photograph the bird on the nest that\nI was moved to seek the boat and push off from the little island in the\nUpper Thames on which it had its home. The other encounter was on a\nDevonshire trout stream, and my only weapon was a fragile trout rod. The\ncertainty that discretion is, under these circumstances, the better part\nof valour is emphasised by the knowledge that any violence to the bird\nwould probably lead to a prosecution. Even the smaller geese can inspire\nfear when they dash hissing at intruders; hence, no doubt, the\nnursemaid\'s favourite reproach of children too frightened to "say bo to\na goose," an expression made classical by Swift.\n\nThe majority of these waterfowl are insectivorous in the nursery stage\nand vegetarian when full grown. Fish forms an inappreciable portion of\ntheir food, with the two notorious exceptions of the goosander and\nmerganser, though anglers are much exercised over the damage, real or\nalleged, done by these birds to their favourite roach and dace in the\nThames. These swans belong for the most part to either the Crown or the\nDyers\' and Vintners\' Companies, and the practice of "uppings," which\nconsists in marking the beaks of adult birds and pinioning the cygnets,\nis still, though shorn of some of its former ceremonial, observed some\ntime during the month of June.\n\nSwans, like both of the other groups, are distinguished by a separate\nname for either sex: pen and cob for the swan, gander and goose, drake\nand duck, and the figurative use of some of these terms in such popular\nsayings as "making ducks and drakes of money," "sauce for the goose,"\netc., is too familiar to call for more than passing mention.\n\nNearly all these waterfowl, though seen on dry land to much the same\ndisadvantage as fish out of water, are exceedingly graceful in either\nair or water, though not all ducks are as capable of diving as the name\nwould imply. The proverbial futility of a wild goose chase recognises\nthe pace of these birds on the wing, which, though, in common with that\nof some other birds, popularly exaggerated, is considerably faster than,\nowing to their short wings and heavy build, might appear to the careless\nobserver.\n\nDucks have a curious habit of adding down to the nest after the eggs are\nlaid and before incubation, and this provision of warm packing is turned\nto account in Iceland and other breeding places of the eider duck,\ncommercially the most valuable of all ducks. The nest is robbed of this\ndown once before the eggs hatch out, with the result that the female\nplucks another store from her own breast, supplemented if necessary from\nthe body of the drake. The sitting bird is then left in peace till the\nnest has fulfilled its purpose, when the remaining down is likewise\nremoved. This down, which combines warmth and lightness, gives a high\nmarket value to the eider, which, throughout Scandinavian countries is\nstrictly protected by law and even more effectually by public opinion.\n\nThe majority of ornamental ducks interbreed freely in captivity. Those\nwho, apparently on reliable evidence, distinguish between the polygamous\nhabit in tame ducks and the constancy of the mallard and other wild\nkinds to a single mate have hastily assumed that such hybrids are\nunknown in the natural state. This, however, is incorrect, as there have\nbeen authentic cases of crosses between mallard and teal, pochard and\nscaup and other species, such hybrids having at different times been\nerroneously accepted as distinct species and named accordingly.\n\nThe wild duck\'s nest is usually placed on the ground in some sheltered\nspot close to still or running water, and the ducklings swim like corks,\nsoon learning the proper use of their flat little bills in gobbling up\nfloating insects and other waterlogged food. Occasionally ducks nest in\ntrees and they have been known to take possession of a deserted rook\'s\nnest. There has been some discussion as to whether, in this case, the\nmother conveys her ducklings to the water in her bill, but this has not\nactually been witnessed. In cases where, as is often observed, the nest\noverhangs the water, it has been suggested that the young birds may\nsimply be pushed over the edge and allowed to parachute down to the\nsurface, as they might easily do without risk.\n\nTame ducks are among the most sociable of birds and can even display\nbravery when threatened by a common enemy. The naturalist Houssay once\nlearnt this as the result of a somewhat cruel experiment that he made in\norder to ascertain whether ducks invariably, as alleged, fall upon a\nwounded comrade and destroy it. Wishing to satisfy himself on the point,\nHoussay, having come upon some ducks in a small pond, deliberately\npelted them with stones till he had wounded one of their number.\nInstead, however, of behaving as he had been led to expect, the rest of\nthe ducks formed close order round the wounded bird and sheltered it\nfrom further harm.\n\nFew domestic animals--none, possibly, with the single exception of the\ncamel--are less suggestive of "pets" than such gross poultry, yet even a\ngander, the most vicious tempered of them all, has been known to show\nlasting gratitude for an act of kindness. The bird, which had long been\nthe terror of children in the little Devonshire village near which it\nlived, managed one day to get wedged in a drain, and there it would\neventually have died unseen if a passing labourer had not seen its\nplight and set it at liberty. Down to the day of its death the bird,\nthough nowise relinquishing its spiteful attitude towards others,\nfollowed its rustic benefactor about the place like a dog.\n\n\n\n\nDECEMBER\n\nTHE ROBIN REDBREAST\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROBIN REDBREAST\n\n\nOf all the old proverbs that are open to argument, few offer more\nmaterial for criticism than that which has it that a good name is more\neasily lost than won; and if ever a living creature served to illustrate\nthe converse to the proverbial dog with a bad name, that creature is the\ncompanionable little bird that we peculiarly associate with Christmas.\nTraditionally, the robin is a gentle little fellow of pious associations\nand with a tender fancy for covering the unburied dead with leaves; but\nin real life he is a little fire-eater, always ready to pick a quarrel\nwith his less pugnacious neighbours. Yet so persistently does his good\nname cling, that, while ever ready to condemn the aggressive sparrow for\nthe same fault, all of us have a good word for the robin, and in few of\nour wild birds are character and reputation so divergent.\n\nSurely, however, the most interesting aspect of this familiar bird is\nits tameness, not to say attachment to ourselves, and so marked is its\ncomplete absence of fear that it is a wild bird in name only, and\nindeed few cage birds are ever so bold as to perch on the gardener\'s\nspade on the look-out for the worms as he turns them up from the damp\nsoil. The robin might, in fact, furnish the text of a lay-sermon on the\nfruits of kindness to animals, and those dialectical people who ask\nwhether we are kind to the robin because it trusts us, or whether, on\nthe other hand, it trusts us because we are kind to it, ask a foolish\nquestion that raises a wholly unnecessary confusion between cause and\neffect. It is a question that those, at any rate, who have seen the bird\nin countries where it is treated differently will have no difficulty\nwhatever in answering. Broadly speaking, the redbreast has the best time\nof it in northern lands. This tolerance has not, as has been suggested,\nany connection with Protestantism, for such a distinction would exclude\nthe greater part of Ireland, where, as it happens, the bird is as safe\nfrom persecution as in Britain, since the superstitious peasants firmly\nbelieve that anyone killing a "spiddog" will be punished by a lump\ngrowing on the palm of his hand. The untoward fate of the robin in Latin\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean has nothing to do with religion,\nbut is merely the result of a pernicious habit of killing all manner of\nsmall birds for the table. The sight of rows of dead robins laid out on\npoulterers\' stalls in the markets of Italy and southern France inspires\nsuch righteous indignation in British tourists as to make them forget\nfor the moment that larks are exposed in the same way in Bond Street and\nat Leadenhall. In Italy and Provence, taught by sad experience the robin\nis as shy as any other small bird. It has learnt its lesson like the\nrobins in the north, but the lesson is different. The most friendly\nrobin I ever remember meeting with, out of England was in a garden\nattached to a café in Trebizond, where, hopping round my chair and\npicking up crumbs, it made me feel curiously at home. Similar treatment\nof other wild birds would in time produce the same result, and even the\nsuspicious starling and stand-off rook might be taught to forget their\nfear of us. The robin, feeding less on fruit and grain than on worms and\ninsects, has not made an enemy of the farmer or gardener. The common,\ntoo common, sparrow, is another fearless neighbour, but its freedom\nfrom persecution, of late somewhat threatened by Sparrow Clubs, is due\nless to affection than to the futility of making any impression on such\nhordes as infest our streets.\n\nNo act of the robin\'s more forcibly illustrates its trust in man than\nthe manner in which, at a season when all animals are abnormally shy and\nsuspicious, it makes its nest not only near our dwellings, but actually\nin many cases under the same roof as ourselves. Letterboxes, flowerpots,\nold boots, and bookshelves have all done duty, and I even remember a\npair of robins, many years ago in Kent, bringing up two broods in an old\nrat trap which, fortunately too rusty to act, was still set and baited\nwith a withered piece of bacon. Pages might be filled with the mere\nenumeration of curious and eccentric nesting sites chosen by this\nfearless bird, but a single proof of its indifference to the presence of\nman during the time of incubation may be cited from the MS. notebooks of\nthe second Earl of Malmesbury, which I have read in the library at Heron\nCourt. It seems that, while the east wing of that pleasant mansion was\nbeing built, a pair of robins, having successfully brought up one family\nin one of the unfinished rooms, actually reared a second brood in a hole\nmade for a scaffold-pole, though the sitting bird, being immediately\nbeneath a plank on which the plasterers stood at work, was repeatedly\nsplashed with mortar! The egg of the robin is subject to considerable\nvariety of type. I think it was the late Lord Lilford who, speaking on\nthe subject of a Bill for the protection of wild birds\' eggs, then\nbefore the House of Lords, gave it as his belief that no ornithologist\nof repute would swear to the name of a single British bird\'s egg without\npositively seeing one or other of the parent birds fly off the nest.\nThis was, perhaps, a little overstating the difficulty of evidence,\nsince any schoolboy with a fancy for birds-nesting might without\nhesitation identify such pronounced types as those of the chaffinch,\nwith its purple blotches, the song-thrush with its black spots on a blue\nground, or the nightingale, which resembles a miniature olive. Eggs, on\nthe other hand, like those of the house sparrow, redshank and some of\nthe smaller warblers, are so easily confused with those of allied\nspecies that Lord Lilford\'s caution is by no means superfluous.\nOrdinarily speaking, the robin\'s egg is white, with red spots at one\nend, but I remember taking at Bexley, nearly thirty years ago, an\nimmaculate one of coffee colour. As the robin is a favourite\nfoster-parent with cuckoos, my first thought was that this might be an\nunusually small egg of the parasitic bird, which was very plentiful\nthereabouts. It so happened, however, that three days after I had\nabstracted the first and only egg I took from that nest, there was a\nsecond of the same type; and, much as I would have liked this also for\nmy collection, I left it in the nest so as to set all doubts at rest. My\nmoderation was rewarded, for no one else found the nest, and in due\ncourse the coffee-coloured egg produced a robin like the rest.\n\nThe robin is anything but a gregarious bird. Its fighting temper\ndoubtless leads it to keep its own company, and we rarely see more than\none singing on the same bush, or seeking for food on the same lawn. Yet,\nthough it is with us all the year, it is known to perform migrations\nwithin these islands, and possibly also overseas, chiefly connected with\ncommissariat difficulties, and it is probable that on such occasions\nmany robins may travel in company, though I have not been so fortunate\nas to come across them in their pilgrimage. Equally interesting,\nhowever, is the habit which the bird has in Devonshire of occasionally\ngoing down to the rocks on the seashore, as I have often noticed in the\nneighbourhood of Teignmouth and Torquay. What manner of food the\nredbreast may find in such surroundings is a mystery, but there it\ncertainly spends some of its time, bobbing at the edge of the rock pools\nin much the same fashion as the dipper on inland waters.\n\nYoung robins are turned adrift at an early age to look after themselves,\na result of the parent bird always rearing two families in the year, and\nin many cases even three, so that they have not too much time to devote\nto the upbringing of each. Another consequence of this prolific habit is\nthat the robin has to make its nest earlier than most of our wild birds,\nand its nest has, in fact, been found near Torquay during the first week\nof January.\n\nIt has long been the pardonable fancy of Englishmen exiled to new homes\nunder the palms or pines, in the scorching tropical sun or in the biting\nnorthern blast, to misname all manner of conspicuous birds after\nwell-remembered kinds left at home in the woods and fields of the old\ncountry. As might be expected of a bird so characteristic of English\nscenes, and so closely associated with the festival that always brings\nnostalgia to the emigrant, the robin has its share of these namesakes,\nand several of them bear little likeness to the original. In New South\nWales, I remember being shown a "robin" which, though perhaps a little\nsmaller, was not unlike our own bird, but the "robin" that was pointed\nout to me in the States, from Maine to Carolina, was as big as a thrush.\nYet it had the red breast, by which, particularly conspicuous against a\nbackground of snow, this popular little bird is always recognisable, the\nmale as well as the female. Indeed, to all outward appearance the sexes\nare absolutely alike, a striking contrast to the cock and hen pheasant,\nthe first bird dealt with in these notes, as this is the last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Birds in the Calendar, by Frederick G.

In spite of the\nconsiderable progress made towards that end, many typical specimens\nare still wanting, and, while we have plenty of material for the study\nof weaving in various parts of the world, we are lacking in everything\nrelating to the industry in Ancient Egypt and Greece. Failing\nspecimens I have had recourse to illustrations, but the Egyptian ones\npublished by Cailliaud, Rosellini, Sir J. G. Wilkinson and Lepsius,\ncontradict each other in many important points, so that those who\nstudy them find them practically useless for an understanding of the\nart as carried on in the Nile lands. Fortunately, last year, Mr. N. de\nG. Davies, the well-known Egyptologist, hearing of my difficulty, very\ngenerously placed some of his copies of tomb drawings at my disposal,\nand with this invaluable help I have been enabled to complete the\npresent paper, and to lay before Halifax students some new details of\nmanufacture bearing upon their staple industry.\n\n                                                  H. Ling Roth.\n\n  Bankfield Museum, Halifax.\n  April 1913.\n\n\n\n\nI. EGYPTIAN LOOMS.\n\n\nHORIZONTAL LOOMS.[A]\n\nIn the tomb of Chnem-hotep, at Beni Hasan, there is a wall painting of\na horizontal loom with two weavers, women, squatting on either side,\nand at the right in the background is drawn the figure of the\ntaskmaster. There are also figures represented in the act of spinning,\netc. For the present we are concerned with the weaving only.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from the\nillustration in Cailliaud\'s _Recherches_, etc. Same size as\npublished.]\n\nOf this illustration, there appear to be six reproductions. We have\nfirst of all, Fig. 1, that of Fred. Cailliaud (_Recherches sur les\nArts et Métiers_, etc., Paris, 1831) with illustrations of drawings\nmade by himself in the years 1819 to 1822. His publication was\nfollowed by Fig. 2, that of Sir J. G. Wilkinson (_Manners and\nCustoms_, etc., London, 1837). Mr. John Murray, whose house has\npublished Wilkinson\'s work from the first edition to the last, informs\nme that a few of the drawings were made by George Scharf, afterwards\nSir George Scharf, Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, but that\nmost of them seem to have been made by Joseph Bonomi, the well known\nEgyptologist. Wilkinson\'s woodcut, although clearly and neatly done,\nis on a very small scale; nevertheless it admits of a fair comparison\nwith those reproduced on a larger scale.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n    Figs. 1 & 3.

Same size as published.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from\nProf. Percy Newberry\'s _Beni Hasan_, I. Plate 29. Same size as\npublished.]\n\nAfter him, Fig. 3, N. F. J. B. Rosellini began the publication of his\ngreat work (_I Monumenti dell\' Egitto_, Pisa, 1832-1844). The\nsimilarity between the comparatively few drawings published by\nCailliaud and the very large number published by Rosellini is very\ngreat. It is of course quite possible Rosellini may have made use of\nsome of Cailliaud\'s drawings. Five years after Rosellini\'s publication\ncame that of C. R. Lepsius (_Denkmäler_, Leipzig, 1849), Fig. 4, his\ndrawings having been made in the years 1842 to 1845. Since the time of\nLepsius until quite recent years I can trace no further copying until\nwe get the illustration, Fig. 5, in Prof. Percy Newberry\'s _Beni\nHasan_, London, 1910. In this work the reproduction is about one\ntwentieth of the original, or about three fifths of the size of that\nof Wilkinson, and unfortunately so crude as not to be available for\nour present purpose.[B] Lastly we have the reproduction, Fig. 6, from\nMr. N. de Garis Davies\' drawing made in 1903, and now first published\nby kind permission of Mr. F. Ll. Griffith.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep. Size of\noriginal: Height of the figures 9-1/4" = 24·4 cm. Drawn by Mr. N. de\nG. Davies, and now published for the first time by permission of Mr.\nF. Ll. Griffith.]\n\nIn the various reproductions by the above explorers, the only three\nwhich agree very closely are those of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies.\nThe others vary considerably and in essentials do not agree with the\nabove nor with one another. The differences may in the first instance\nbe due to difficulties in copying the original in the tomb. Others may\nbe due to ignorance of detail on the part of the secondary\ncopyist--the man who prepared them for publication--so that he was\nunable to follow up the clues on the drawings laid before him. The\ndifferences may also be due to careless copying and to "touching up"\nof the copies when made; they may be slightly due to deterioration and\nobliteration of the original in the course of time.\n\nThe _Encyclopædia Biblica_ gives a variant from all six illustrations,\nbut approaching nearest to that of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies. It\nis misleading in so far that the drawing has been made to suit\nProfessor Kennedy\'s idea as to what it should be.\n\nSome of the differences are of minor importance, but a comparison will\nhelp materially to our understanding of the method of weaving adopted\nby the Egyptians from the XIIth to the XIXth Dynasties, or about B.C.\n2000 to 1200. To go into details, and taking Mr. N. de G. Davies\'\nillustration as our basis, we find slight differences in the shape of\nthe pegs B, B1, which are immaterial. A more pronounced difference is\nseen in the way in which the threads are attached to the warp beam A.\nNeither Wilkinson nor Lepsius carry these threads over the beam, the\nformer carrying them only as far as the laze threads C, while the\nlatter carries them up to a line drawn parallel to and below the beam;\nCailliaud and Rosellini carry them over the beam while Mr. Davies\ncarries them half way only. The object of this half carrying over is\nnot clear. The threads in chain-form at C are probably laze threads,\napparently placed there so that in case of any disarrangement of the\nwarp threads the weaver can from that point run her fingers along them\nand get them disentangled. It has been suggested to me that this\nchain-form might be a tension chain for taking up slack warp, but the\nformer explanation seems the more likely.\n\nAll the drawings but Wilkinson\'s show the warp threads converging\ntowards the breast beam; Wilkinson shows them parallel and in Lepsius\ntheir convergence is excessive. There should be a slight convergence\nshown, as in the course of weaving the threads get drawn in, and in\nlater forms of looms in semi-civilised countries we find an endeavour\nto counteract this tendency by the use of a tool known as a "temple."\n\nThe cross sticks D1, D2, look like laze rods. It may not be out of\nplace here to point out that in primitive weaving laze rods serve two\npurposes, or one more than in the later somewhat more advanced looms.\nThey serve throughout to keep the warp threads in place, and they\nserve to separate the odd threads from the even (1, 3, 5, 7 from 2, 4,\n6, 8, &c.), and in so doing take the place of the fingers in making\nthe "shed," _i.e._, the opening through which the "weft (or woof)" is\npassed, a function which in turn is usurped by the "heald (or\nheddle)." The heddle therefore becomes a very important factor, and\nDr. H. G. Harrison by no means overstates the case when he says that\nthe development of the heddle is the most important step in the\nevolution of the loom (Horniman Museum Handbooks, No. 10, pp. 47-49).\nWe may now return to the drawing. Wilkinson shows the rod D1\nindistinctly and the left hand end only of D2. Lepsius\' artist seems\nto have taken a liberty with D1 but in the right direction, by making\nit more definitely into an early form of heddle--the loop and rod--but\nhe shows D2 the same as Cailliaud and Rosellini. Prof. Kennedy argues\nthat these rods are in the wrong position and that D1 which is a\nheddle should be in the place of D2. Mr. Davies\' drawing as well as\nthose of Cailliaud and Rosellini show that D1 is a heddle while D2 is\nshown to be a laze rod. Asiatic primitive looms, like those from\nBorneo and Bhutan, have two laze rods but no heddle; on the other hand\nmany primitive African looms have one laze rod and one heddle as is\nthe case with this Egyptian loom. More threads are shown on the left\nhand end of D2 than on the right hand end. Mr. Davies informs me that\nthe same quantity should be shown from end to end across the warp, but\non the right hand side they are so indistinct that he was just able to\ndetect but not to trace them and so he omitted them.\n\nWe now come to the rod E. Cailliaud and Rosellini show an undulation\nat the one end _a_, but do not make the other end clear. Wilkinson\nshows a small hook at the end _a_, which appears to me to be a\ntranscriber\'s development of the curved end of his two predecessors;\nin the text Wilkinson says there is a hook at each end of this stick,\nbut he does not show any at the end opposite to _a_; he refers to\nthese hooks more than once (1st ed., III., p. 126 footnote). Lepsius\nhas altered the shape of the curve and transferred it from the end _a_\nto the opposite end. In Mr. de G. Davies\' drawing, it has been\ninserted in dotted lines, as the original is in such a state that\ntracing is almost impossible. Wilkinson, Erman, v. Cohausen (_Das\nSpinnen u. Weben bei den Alten_, in _Ann. Ver. Nassau. Altherthumsk._,\nWiesbaden, 1879, p. 29), and others call it a shuttle, but I am more\ninclined to consider it a slashing stick ("sword" or "beater-in") for\npushing the weft into position. A tool which appears to be a beater-in\nand of similar end shape is seen held in the hand of a woman on a\nwall painting at El Bersheh--see Fig. 11, top right-hand corner. We\nhave in another illustration, Fig. 7, an article which appears to be a\nspool, which I think confirms the view that E is not the shuttle but\nthe beater-in. In all the illustrations, too, the pose of the hands of\nthe women bearing on this stick is indicative of a downward pressure\nand not of a grasp.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Tomb of the Vizier Daga. Date about end XI.\nDynasty, B.C. 2000. Mr. N. de G. Davies\' _Five Theban Tombs_, Plate\nXXXVII.\n\nThe upper illustration indicates a woman warping or beaming, probably\nwarping.\n\nIn the lower illustration note the left hand figure holding the spool\nin her hand. At first sight this small black line looks like a\ncontinuation of the "beater-in" in the hands of the other weaver, but\nMr. Davies informs me that it is quite a distinct article, and that\nthere can be no doubt about it. Just above the breast beam there are 8\nor 9 threads of weft but they are too faint to be included.]\n\nThe selvedge F on the one side of the cloth and not on both sides is\nalso interesting from the fact that selvedges do not appear on the\nEgyptian cloths until the XVIII. Dynasty _circa_ B.C. 1600.\n\nThe breast beam:--It appears to me that the three portions marked G1,\nG2 and G3 joined up are intended to represent the breast beam and its\nholding pegs, similar to the warp beam A and its pegs B1, B2, but the\nportion K is not clearly drawn in any of the reproductions. Wilkinson\nomits this altogether, but in its place has two black pieces which\nalso are still less clear. Lepsius has omitted G2 altogether and\nappears to have made G1 and K and G3 into treadles, by raising G1\nabove the level of G3, and to support the view that these are\ntreadles, he makes use of the overseer\'s foot by placing it on the\nsupposed treadle, and the casual observer thinks it is the foot of the\nwoman weaver. However, Mr. Davies\' copy seems to offer a solution. He\nagrees with Cailliaud and Rosellini in so far as G1, G2 and G3 are\nconcerned. With him K takes quite a different form, in fact it looks\nvery similar to an article which an attendant woman in another panel\nhas close by her, see Fig. 8. It might perhaps be a rest to prevent\nthe beater-in being driven home too forcibly--this, however, is still\nonly a surmise--as the length of the beater-in makes it heavy at the\nfar end.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Weaver with the support K, Fig. 6; the woman\nappears to hold a beater-in in the right hand and a ball of thread in\nthe left hand. Rosellini.]\n\nIn Cailliaud the warp threads are coloured in pale blue and red on top\nof the black lines of the drawing; he has painted the selvedge and\nfinished cloth a pale blue, as well as that portion of G2 which is\ncovered by the cloth indicating that this is the breast beam, G3 and\nG1 are painted a dark red. Rosellini colours A, B1, B2, D1, D2, G3\norange; G1 and K dark red, but E from end to end light ochre. This\nshows that K is distinct from E.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\n\nUpright or Vertical Looms from the Tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, XVIII\nDynasty, _circa_ B.C. 1425. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies. Size\nof original: Height from Base Line to top of frame at A, 11-1/2" = 29\ncm.]\n\nIn consequence of this loom being represented as upright it is often\nspoken of as an upright or vertical loom. But it is drawn upright\nbecause the Egyptian artist did not understand perspective, and it was\nonly by making the loom upright that he was enabled to show the\ndetails we have just been examining. For the same reason mat making is\nillustrated edgeways. If the loom were an upright one the two women\nweavers would have had their backs turned towards the onlooker as can\nbe seen in Fig. 9. Any doubt on the matter has however been set aside\nby Prof. John Garstang\'s extremely interesting discovery of a wooden\nmodel depicting a group of women spinning and weaving which he\nillustrates in his work, _The Burial Customs of Ancient Egypt_,\nLondon, 1907. After referring to the woman spinning, he continues:\n"The other seated figures apparently represent women at work upon a\nhorizontal loom; the frame and the woof [_sic_, should be _warp_]\nthreads are faintly represented upon the board. It is possible that\nthey are making mats or, perhaps, weaving (p. 132)." He gives an\nillustration of the group taken from a photograph, but as it does not\nshow the lines which indicate the loom lying horizontally on the\nground nor the warp threads, I have asked him to let me have a drawing\nmade of it and, with his kind permission, it is now reproduced here,\nFig. 10. The threads of the warp and the finished piece of cloth at\nthe breast beam end are clearly indicated. The whole model supports\nconclusively the well founded supposition that the loom we have been\nconsidering is a _horizontal_ one. Curiously enough, Prof. Garstang\ndoes not appear to appreciate the important bearing of his discovery,\nfor on a later page (p. 134) in speaking of Lepsius\' illustration,\ndiscussed above, he says: "the weavers are seen at work at an upright\nloom."\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Horizontal Loom. Outline sketch by Miss Davey\nof the original model of a group of one woman spinning and two women\nweaving, found by Dr. John Garstang at Beni Hasan. The model is in the\nMuseum of the Liverpool Institute of Archæology.]\n\nIt must not be thought that the Beni Hasan representation is the only\none which illustrates a horizontal loom. A second one is reproduced by\nProf. Percy Newberry from the tomb of Tehuti-hetep _circa_ 1938-1849\nB.C., see Fig. 11. In the upper portion the women are seen spinning\nand preparing the thread generally, while in the lower portion two\nwomen on the left are warping, and in the centre three apparently are\n"beaming," _i.e._ putting the warp on to the beams preparatory to\ncommencing to weave, the warp threads being apparently drawn over pegs\nto ensure the proper tension. This illustration shows the warp flat\nagainst the wall like the mat making shown at Beni Hasan.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Tomb of Tehuti-hetep. Date about 1939-1849\nB.C. From Professor Percy Newberry\'s _El Bersheh_ I. Pl. 26.\n\nNote the woman on the top right hand corner holding a "beater-in."]\n\nA third representation of a horizontal loom is reproduced from the\nforthcoming volume of the Egypt Exploration Fund by kind permission of\nMr. N. de G. Davies, who made the copy. In this, Fig. 7, already\nreferred to, the lower portion is all that has come down to us. The\ncloth is not shown contracted as in the Beni Hasan representation, the\ntwo laze rods are drawn close to each other and here also an attempt\nappears to have been made to show the over and under lapping warp\nthreads; the laze rods appear each with a hook, the hook on the upper\nrod turned upwards and the hook (if it be one) on the lower rod turned\ndownwards. It is possible these hooks may be pegs to prevent the\nshifting of the laze rods. It may be that one of the two rods is a\nheddle rod the indication being the fine double lines, but this may\nnot be compatible with the hook at the end of the rod. The weaver on\nthe left holds a spool in her hand, evidently a piece of stick with\nthe weft thread wound round it, which she is pushing through with her\nfingers. The weaver on the right holds a beater-in as shown in the\nBeni Hasan drawing. The breast beam is held in position by two pegs\nnear the right one of which there is a curved article of indeterminate\nuse.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Study of a Bedawin Arab weaving, from a\nsketch taken in the Forties of last Century, by Frank Goodall, R.A.\nThe original sketch is in Bankfield Museum. The weaver appears to be\nprovided with one heddle and a beater-in.]\n\nThere is no very clear evidence as to how the finished cloth was\n"taken up" unless we accept it that the bulging out of the part G2\nmeans that it was wound round the breast beam as is done on hand and\npower looms of the present day. Some very long pieces of cloth have\ncome down to us and unless they were "taken up" in this way a long\nstretch of ground would have been necessary. A modified form of this\nhorizontal loom has been met with in recent years among the Bedawin\nArabs, as shown in the illustration of a study sketch, Fig. 12, made\nby Frank Goodall, R.A., in the forties of last century. The loom was\nprovided with pegs like the old Egyptian loom but it was supplied with\na primitive heddle resting on a stone at each side of the warp and it\nwould appear that the weaver, to a certain extent, did not take up the\nwoven cloth by winding it round the breast beam and by that means\nretaining his position, but, as the weaving progressed and the line of\nfinished cloth got beyond his reach, he crept up to it and so got\nfarther and farther away from the breast beam until in the end he\narrived at the warp beam. Similar looms are still used for mat making\nby the Egyptian fellah.\n\n\nVERTICAL LOOMS.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Upright or vertical loom. Wilkinson\'s\n_Ancient Egyptians_, London, John Murray. 1st ed., Vol. III., p. 135.]\n\nApart from the horizontal loom Wilkinson and Robert Hay[C] also\nrecorded the existence of an illustration of an upright loom, said in\nerror to be at Eileithyias (El Kab). Wilkinson\'s copy, Fig. 13, is\nmore elaborate than that of Hay. Mr. Davies informs me that the\noriginal is not at Eileithyias, but in the tomb of Nefer-hotep at\nThebes. Wilkinson in regard to this illustration quotes the\noft-repeated statement of Herodotus (_circa_ 460-455 B.C.) in\nreference to looms in general:--"Other nations make cloth by pushing\nthe woof upwards, the Egyptians on the contrary, press it down." On\nthis statement Wilkinson remarks: "This is confirmed by the paintings\nwhich represent the process of making cloth; but at Thebes, a man who\nis engaged in making a piece of cloth with a coloured border or\nselvedge, appears to push the woof upwards, the cloth being fixed\nabove him, to the upper part of the frame" [Fig. 13]. But I am unable\nto follow Wilkinson in this, for I can find no indication in his\nillustration which shows how the beating-in of the weft is\naccomplished. From the illustration all one can say is that it might\nhave been done either way. Wilkinson\'s illustration is lettered from\n_a_ to _p_ but this lettering is not explained by him at all,\nexcepting in the case of the letter _k_, of which he says: "_k_ is a\nshuttle, not thrown, but put in with the hand. It had a hook at the\nend ..." and he proceeds to refer to the drawing elsewhere of the\nhorizontal loom. He does not show the hooks in his illustration. In\nFig. 14, I give the sketch made by Mr. N. de G. Davies of the remains\nof the original from which Wilkinson made his illustration.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies, Jan. 1913, of\nan Upright Loom in Tomb 49 at Thebes, belonging to Nefer-hotep, at end\nof XVIII. Dynasty, B.C. 1330. Drawn when in a better state by\nWilkinson, Fig. 13, and Hay.]\n\nA more satisfactory drawing of upright looms is that which Mr. N. de\nG. Davies has placed at my disposal for reproduction here. I append\nhis description, Fig. 9. "The picture of men working at two looms is\ntaken from the tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, who was a royal scribe\nin the middle of the 18th Dynasty, _circa_ 1425 B.C. In his tomb his\nhouse is shown. He himself sits in the hall, while inside some\nservants spin and weave, make bread, store the grain, etc. The roof of\nthe chambers is supported on pillars, and between two of these the\nlooms are set up which are here depicted. They are not attached\nhowever, either to the roof or the pillars. Faint sketching lines are\nmixed up with the darker reds in which the picture was re-drawn, and\nthe whole very simply and carelessly executed. I have found it\ndifficult to make it clear. In my sketch the first faint sketching\noutlines appear as lines. The more solid red lines which replaced\nthese I have \'hatched,\' and certain portions including the men\'s flesh\ncolour, the stools, the discs I have put in solid black, partly\nbecause they are for the most part more solid and dark red in the\noriginal, and partly to distinguish the portions more clearly from one\nanother. The horizontal lines which cross the web are very faintly\ndrawn and almost as good as obliterated by the white paint which had\nbeen put on the web. I have put them in just to show that the bars\nwere _conceived_ of as passing behind or under the web and concealed\nby it.\n\n"The larger loom is worked by two men, the smaller by one man only.\nThe looms consist of an oblong frame A set up on two stones B. The\nwarp is attached to the warp beam C on top and the breast beam D at\nthe bottom. The threads of the warp are not shown, no difference being\nmade between any woven part and the warp threads; to all is given one\nsmear of white paint. Two discs E are seen hanging against the frame\nposts, one on each side, the earlier sketch showing a larger disc than\nthe final drawing in dark red.\n\n"Two slender laze rods F are shown on the large loom and heavy bars G,\nH, lower down; a somewhat similar laze rod and beams are also shown on\nthe smaller loom.\n\n"The weavers sit on benches with their backs to the spectator. The\nartist has not dared to draw a back view of their heads, but has\nturned each man\'s head to the right to show a profile. They are\nholding a heavy looking rod which looks like a \'beater-in.\' One would\nexpect to see a shuttle but perhaps this was too small an object for\nso rough a picture--perhaps the man at the smaller loom holds an\nexaggerated shuttle L in his right hand.\n\n"The lines M seen alongside the framework are the faint red sketch\nlines _not_ cords. The diagonal line N on the left I do not\nunderstand, it does not seem an accidental one.\n\n"On the left hand of the two looms the original shows a man spinning\ncoarse thread into finer(?) using two spindles at once; the threads\npass through rings fixed in the ceiling as in a picture at Beni Hasan.\nBehind him two girls are breaking up the flax and two others are\nmaking coarse threads of the fibres, almost exactly like those in the\ntomb of Daga (No. 103) a couple of hundred yards away."\n\nTo this description of Mr. Davies I would like to add a word about\nthe discs E. Wilkinson indicates these as rings apparently joining the\nhorizontal beam to the post of the frame, the form of the ring being\narrived at as explained by Mr. Davies by the original outline of the\nsketch having been made larger than the final drawing of the circle,\nor disc, and not obliterated. In Mr. Davies\' drawing these discs hang\non or are fixed on to the uprights only, and I am inclined to think\nthey represent balls of weft thread hanging up in the same way as we\nsee whole rows of coloured balls hanging on the looms of Persian\nrugmakers, and as can be seen on an Indian rug loom in Bankfield\nMuseum.\n\nIt is also very clear that these Egyptian vertical looms are very\ndifferent from the Greek looms in so far as we know anything about\nthem. The Greek looms had an upper beam only and the warp threads were\nbunched at the lower end and weighted with metal or clay balls to keep\nthem taut, Fig. 15. The _individual_ warp threads were not weighted;\nthey were bunched and then weighted. The pyramidal shaped clay warp\nweights found in Egypt are I understand considered by Egyptologists to\nbelong to the Roman period, but in the Manchester University Museum\nthere is a mud article which Miss M. A. Murray describes as a warp\nweight, Fig. 17, so that it is possible vertical looms with warp\nweights may yet be forthcoming as an Egyptian and not a foreign\nindustrial tool. But Dr. H. R. Hall informs me this weight was\nprobably found in the ruins of houses where Ægean pottery was found\nand hence it is probably a temporary warp weight of those people and\nnot an Egyptian article.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Greek loom with spool and warp weights.\nIllustration on a skyphos (van Branteghem vase in the Ashmolean\nMuseum, Oxford). From H. B. Walters\' paper on _Odysseus & Kirke_ on a\nBoeotian vase, Jour. Hellenic Studies, 1892-3 XIII. p. 81.]\n\nSince writing the above Mr. N. de G. Davies has very kindly sent me on\na new set of illustrations, Fig. 16, of which he says; "My attention\nwas called to the scene by Dr. Alan Gardiner. The scenes which\nrepresent the preparation of the flax and the stretching of the warp\nare almost replicas of those in the tomb of Daga of the Middle\nKingdom, so far as we can judge, while the pictures of the looms\nresemble closely those in the tombs of Thot-nefer and Nefer-hotep. The\nwork is done by both men and women. Men prepare the flax while women\nstretch the warp. Men mostly work the loom, either singly or with a\ncompanion. But in one case a woman is seen at work at one of the\nupright looms. She is shewn sitting sideways on the low bench and is\nnot pictured in a back view with widely spread legs like the men.\nUnfortunately the work is so slovenly and so much injured that few\nexact outlines can be secured, and hence all detail is insecure.\nThere are also superfluous lines in red colour which confuse the\npicture. The tomb is Ramesside in date (_circa_ 1200 B.C.) The\ninscription over the seated man is too broken to be read."\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 16a.--Weavers at work as represented in the Tomb\nof Nefer-ronpet, Superintendent of Weavers at Thebes. Date about 1200\nB.C. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 16b.--Weavers at work as represented in the Tomb\nof Nefer-ronpet, Superintendent of Weavers at Thebes. Date about 1200\nB.C. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies.]\n\nThe drawings appear to confirm generally what we have gathered from\nMr. Davies\' previous illustration, Fig. 9.\n\n\nPORTIONS OF LOOMS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US.\n\nIn so far as I know, not many loom parts have yet been discovered, and\nthose which I have had an opportunity of studying do not assist us to\nmuch knowledge beyond that which we have gained by a study of the wall\npaintings. We have the article from Kahun already mentioned, which may\npossibly be a warp weight, as it somewhat resembles the later warp\nweights found elsewhere. It is of hardened mud with a perforation at\nthe thin end through which a piece of string has been passed and\nknotted (Fig. 17), but so far no illustration of a loom with weights\nhas been found, either for the period to which this article belongs or\nto any other period. On the other hand the material is not suitable\nfor a net-sinker, nor is it intended to be made to stand up. As\nmentioned above it is probably Ægean.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Piece of perforated hardened mud. Possibly a\nwarp weight, 10 cm. × 8·7 × 4·2 (3-15/16 in. × 2-7/16 in. × 1-5/8 in.)\nWeight 470 gramms (1 lb. 1/2 oz.) Probably of Ægean origin. _Kahun._\nManchester Museum.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Burnt-clay warp weight. Height 11·4 cm. (4-1/4\nin.) Weight 260 gramms (9-1/4 oz.) Probably Roman. Bankfield Museum.\n(Received from Prof. Flinders Petrie).]\n\nAnother form of warp weight, of burnt clay, is somewhat frequently met\nwith, Fig. 18, but it is described as appertaining to Roman times, and\nmay therefore be either a Greek or Roman article. Similar weights from\nCyprus and North Africa, &c., can be seen in the British Museum.\n\nWooden pegs have been found at Gurob, which may possibly have been\nused for holding the warp and breast beams in position, Fig. 19. These\npegs may appear to be rather short for the purpose, but in very\nprimitive looms the warp is not kept so taut as might and should be,\nand hence there is not the same heavy strain on the pegs as we should\ndeem necessary. The way to settle their use would be to fix them in\nsolid ground and test them.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Wooden Peg, possibly used for holding the\nwarp and breast beams. Length 13·5 to 10·2 cm.

But one at least, Fig. 22, has been found with XVIIIth\nto XIXth Dynasty articles at Gurob, that is belonging to the period\n1580-1150 B.C., which is long before Rome existed. None of these\nso-called combs, for they are really embryo reeds, are shown on the\nwall illustrations so that they no doubt belong to a later date than\nthat of the XIIth Dynasty. If, as I take it, these "combs" are the\nforerunners of the reed and were used to drive the weft threads home,\nand if also the Romans had upright looms provided with warp weights\ninstead of the breast beam, then I think the "comb" may not be Roman\nbut may be a late Egyptian invention. For, on trying to use such a\ncomb on a _replica_ of a Scandinavian upright loom provided with warp\nweights (instead of with the breast beam) I can get no good result, in\nfact rather the opposite, but tried on a primitive horizontal loom\nprovided with a breast beam the comb is found to be of some\nassistance, especially if the warp is not very taut as is generally\nthe case with primitive looms. At Bankfield we have an Indian rug\nloom, already referred to, with warp and breast beam on which a\nsomewhat similar instrument, but of iron, was used.[D]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Weaver\'s Comb--a Beater-in. 19·5 cm. × 9·8 ×\n4·2 (7-3/4 in. × 3-7/8 in. × 1-5/8 in.) _Gurob._ Manchester Museum.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Possibly a warp spacer, somewhat similar in\nobject to the raddle of modern hand loom weaving.

(Received from Prof. Flinders\nPetrie).]\n\nAn article which Prof. Flinders Petrie describes as a "warp spacer" is\nshown in Fig. 23. From fragments in the Egyptian Collection,\nUniversity College, London, it would appear to have been originally\nmore than a meter (three feet) long. It may have been used as a sort\nof a "raddle," a tool used for assisting to keep the warp threads in\nposition when being beamed, _i.e._ put on to the loom. At Bankfield we\nhave an old local hand loom the warp beam of which is provided with a\nseries of holes in which pegs were once inserted to keep the coloured\nwarp threads in position.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\n\n1/2 size of end of Fig. 24.\n\n1/2 size section of Fig. 24.\n\nA long piece of perforated wood described by Prof. Flinders Petrie,\n_Kahun_, p. 29, as a Weaver\'s Beam for making rush mats. Length 96·8\ncm. × 8·0 × 3·0 (3 ft. 1-1/4 in. × 3-1/4 in. × 1-3/16 in.) From\nManchester Museum.]\n\nA piece of frame, Fig. 24, has been described as a "weaver\'s beam" for\nmaking rush mats like the modern _hasira_. It is provided with 28\nholes which are arranged about 27 to 40 mm. apart. The holes may have\nbeen more or less circular originally, and worn into present shape by\nthreads, etc., and look more irregular inside than they really are, as\nthe inside surface of the holes is fairly smooth; the holes are\nslightly larger, on an average about 4 mm., on the face shown than on\nthe other face. Prof. Flinders Petrie seems to think it resembles the\nframe on which the modern Egyptian mat is made.\n\nWe now come to the two reeds in the Museum of the Liverpool Institute\nof Archæology, which Dr. John Garstang discovered near Abu Kirkas,\ntomb No. 693, of which he tells us: "They are 27 and 29 inches (68·6\nand 73·7 cm.) in length respectively, and are precisely similar in\ngeneral form. They are constructed on a system of nineteen or twenty\nreeds to the inch, and they may be seen to be exactly similar to the\nmodern reed taken from a loom in the village of Abu Kirkas. It is not\npossible, unfortunately, to assign a precise date to these objects.\nThey were found in a tomb which contained no other remains; this tomb\nwas surrounded by others, all of them likewise very much disturbed,\nbut equally characteristic of the general nature of the Middle Empire\ntombs, and containing nothing but Middle Empire objects. Since, in\ngeneral, few tombs of this site show signs of intrusive burial of a\nlater age, there is no reason to suppose that these objects are of any\ndate later than the XII. Dynasty (_The Burial Customs of Ancient\nEgypt_, London, 1907, pp. 134-136)."\n\nThe horizontal looms we have been describing belong to this period,\nand the artists have not shown any reeds with them. My studies of\nprimitive looms lead me to think that these Egyptian looms are of a\ndate far anterior to the invention or the application of a reed. It\nhas also, I believe, been remarked by those who have examined cloths\nof this date, that the irregular array of the warp threads is good\nproof that reeds could not have been in use. I have already pointed\nout that in the evolution of the loom the reed puts in a late\nappearance, but apart from this fact, I do not think the artist would\nhave omitted such an important tool had it been in use in his time.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Reed in Cairo Museum. Length 66 cm. (26 in.)\nIt consists of two wooden frames fitted with flat iron wires. String\nis wound round the frames binding them together. Then a kind of\ncanvas(?) cover in placed over the frames to cover up the projecting\nends of the wires, but this has disappeared in places.]\n\nDr. Garstang points out that although the surrounding tombs contained\nMiddle Empire objects, the reeds were found in a tomb _without_ any\nother remains. This can hardly be considered evidence tending to prove\nthat they belonged to the period named, and it is certainly weakened\nby the accompanying statement that the reeds are _exactly_ similar to\nthe modern reed, for that is almost sufficient to prove that they are\n_not_ 3900-3700 years old. To me they seem comparatively modern and\nvery similar to one in the Cairo Museum which MM. Brugsch and Quibell\nare inclined to think is Coptic with this difference, that in Dr.\nGarstang\'s reeds the divisions appear to be of cane or wood, while in\nthe Cairo reed they are of iron (?steel). The sketch of this Coptic\nreed, Fig. 25, has been drawn specially for me, and Miss W. M.\nCrompton, Assistant Keeper in Egyptology in the Manchester University\nMuseum, has kindly examined the sketch with the article and pronounced\nit correct. We may, I think, safely conclude that the reed found by\nDr. Garstang is Coptic and not Ancient Egyptian.\n\nAs regards the actual work of weaving, balls of thread have been found\nand so have very flat bobbins and pieces of stick with thread wound\nround which may have been spools as indicated in the drawing, Fig. 7.\nThere is no reason why balls of thread should not have been used as\nthey are in uncivilised countries at the present day, as, for\ninstance, in Tibet, as reported by W. W. Rockhill in _Diary of a\nJourney through Mongolia and Thibet_, Washington, 1894, p. 41.\n\n\n"DIAGONAL WEAVING."\n\nI am unable to agree with a recently made statement published in _The\nLabyrinth, Gerzeh and Marghuneh_, by Prof. Flinders Petrie, E. A.\nWainwright and E. Mackey, p. 6, which runs: "The fact of the weft not\nbeing at right angles to the warp, if one may conclude by the fabrics,\ndoes not, I think, imply that such weaving is of inferior quality.\nWhen I noticed the peculiarity first, I thought it might have arisen\nthrough distortion by stretching over the body, but repeated examples\nof the same fact have led me to consider other causes. We know how\nclosely analogous to \'darning\' was the early weaving; and in our days\nit is not unusual to find stockings not darned at right angles, and it\nmay be the women weavers of old sometimes put in the weft more or less\nout of true right angle. In the childhood of weaving we should expect\ndifferent methods, and it may be, seeing that we have no selvedged\ncloth until very long after this time, that they experimented with a\ndiagonal weft to see if it would not reduce the tendency to fray out\nat the sides." The amount the warp and weft are out of the right angle\nis stated to be about 20°. The specimen shown me under the microscope\nindicated clearly that the warp and weft were not at right angles and\nthat the interstices were not square but diamond shaped.\n\nIt is possible to arrange the warp threads diagonally from beam to\nbeam, but with continuous weft (that is in weaving so as to get\nselvedges) the weft has the tendency to slip up on one side and down\non the other, hence the weaving is made laborious. With a separate\nweft for each pick, _i.e._, for every once the shed is opened, there\nis naturally not this tendency, but this alleged diagonally woven\ncloth frays just as easily as any other piece of cloth without\nselvedge, so in either case there is not only no advantage but\ndistinct disadvantage taking the diagonal "beaming" into\nconsideration. We must give the Egyptians credit for using the least\nlaborious of two methods, that is _if_ the second one were known to\nthem.\n\nApparent diagonal weaving can be produced by anyone taking an ordinary\npiece of linen or cotton cloth, cutting off the selvedge and\nstretching the cloth in a direction diagonally to the direction of the\nwarp and weft, and a piece of diagonally woven cloth is the result!\n\nThe probability is that the specimen of cloth, without a selvedge,\nhaving been stretched over the body for a long period of time, has, in\nthe course of that time lost its nature and when removed it has\nretained its altered form and gives us the impression of having been\nwoven diagonally.\n\n\n"THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III."\n\nIn the foregoing I have shown how extremely simple was the whole\napparatus for weaving in use by the Ancient Egyptians, and one is\nrather surprised to be told that about B.C. 1200, in the time of\nRameses III., the Egyptians "built and used looms very much more\ncomplicated than has hitherto been believed to be the case," or to be\nreferred to "the really complicated form of loom used." Yet this is\nwhat Mr. Thorold D. Lee tells us (pp. 84 and 86) in his paper on _The\nLinen Girdle of Rameses III._ (_Ann. of Archæology and Anthropology of\nthe Liverpool Institute of Archæology_, July, 1912, V.)\n\nThe characteristics of this girdle are its great length, 17 feet (5 m.\n2), its even taper diminishing from 5 in. (12·7 cm.) in width to 1-7/8\nin. (4·8 cm.) in width, its elaborate design and excellent\nworkmanship. Perhaps the chief of these characteristics is the taper.\nIt is most probable, as Mr. Lee points out, that in the weaving the\nwarp threads have been gradually dropped out to make the taper, rather\nthan that additional warp threads have been added. As it is easy to\ndrop a warp thread, and almost impossible to add one while weaving is\nin progress, Mr. Lee\'s view is confirmed by this. It would also be\nalmost impossible to keep the warp taut if the number of warp threads\nwere increased as the work went on. This means that the girdle was\ncommenced at the wide end and finished at the narrow end.\n\nIt is common knowledge that when a warp thread drops out, its place is\nindicated by a thinness or fine opening for the whole length of the\nmissing warp, and this is so because the reed, besides pushing the\nweft into position, also acts as a warp spacer, that is to say it\nkeeps the warp threads properly apart, every one being properly\naligned. When no reed is used the warp threads are not so evenly\nplaced--they are not so parallel to one another for there is nothing\nbut their tautness to keep them in position. Hence there is every\nreason to conclude that when, on a loom provided with a reed, warp\nthreads have been removed their position must be indicated, and _vice\nversa_ if no reed has been used the position of the removed threads\nwill not be so clearly indicated, but there will be a more marked\nshrinkage in the width of the cloth as well as in the pattern, and\nthis is what has taken place in the girdle giving us the diminishing\ntaper.\n\n[Illustration: "THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III."\n\n_Reproduced by kind permission of Dr. Clubb, Director, The Museums,\nLiverpool._]\n\nIf this diminishing taper were indicated by a decrease in the width of\nthe pattern commencing at the selvedges, then it might be presumed\nthat a reed had been used for the central portion only--a very clumsy\neven if feasible arrangement, but the pattern begins to decrease along\nthe middle and hence no reed could have been used.\n\nIt does not follow that because a loom was not provided with a reed it\nwas without heddles. Anyone who will examine the large series of\nprimitive looms at Bankfield Museum, will observe that heddles\npreceded reeds; this must necessarily be so as the making of the shed\nis the first step in weaving, while the reed\'s work is more that of a\nfinisher. But the heddles are all extremely primitive, and in my\nexperience do not exceed four in number where there is no reed. Such a\nquantity of heddles with its complicated harness as Mr. Lee considers\nnecessary is quite out of the question with a loom so undeveloped as\nnot to be provided with a reed. Hence the indication is that the\ngirdle was woven on a loom of a primitive character.\n\nIn carrying out the work the weaver has made many mistakes. On the\nleft hand side of the right hand row of red crosses (they come out\nblack in the photograph) there is an "end down" for a considerable\ndistance--that is a thread has been missed.\n\nOn the same row of crosses three white threads show above and below,\nwhile on the left hand row of crosses there are five white threads\nabove and below. The crosses are neither the same size nor shape in\nthe two columns and curiously their white hafts in both columns point\nto the left instead of one row pointing to the left and the other to\nthe right. Then again the white point at the right apex of the zigzag\non the left corresponds to a red point at the left apex of the right\nhand zigzag, but if the girdle had been woven on an advanced loom with\ndobby and harness these points would have been red in both places.\n\nAs regards the large number of warp threads to the inch which Mr. Lee\nputs down as 272-340 (107-134 per cm.), this does not by any means\nindicate a complicated piece of machinery for the weaving of this belt\nor any other fabric. The greater the number of threads to the inch the\nfiner must the threads be in order to get them into the allotted\nspace, and in the weaving there will be so many more threads to raise\nand lower in order to make the shed opening. It means multiplying the\nwork but does not necessarily mean that a more complicated loom must\nbe used in the weaving.\n\nIt is not possible without opening the fabric to be quite positive on\nthe many points which are raised, but there seems nothing about it\nwhich should prevent its having been made on a simple loom. Although\nsuperior to most, but not all, of the well known Coptic cloths in\nBankfield and in many other museums, it very closely resembles some of\nthem in many respects excepting in the taper.\n\nI should add that in making my examination of this girdle I was kindly\nassisted by Mr. C. A. Trigg, a well known Halifax mill manager and\ndesigner. We made the examination independently and on comparing notes\nafterwards found that we agreed in all essential points.\n\n\nAN EXAMINATION OF FIFTEEN SPECIMENS OF MUMMY WRAPPINGS.\n\nBy W. W. MIDGLEY, Curator, retired, The Museums, Bolton.\n\n"So far back as 1834, Mummy cloths occupied the attention of James\nThompson, F.R.S., who, after researches into their characteristics and\nstructure wrote a paper on the subject, which appears in the London\nand Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, Vol. V., page 355. From that\ntime until quite recently, little additional knowledge on the subject\nhas appeared. In the early part of 1910, Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie,\nF.R.S., expressed a desire that the writer should undertake\nmicroscopic investigation of the body-wrappings of cloths of the III.\nand early IV. Dynasties (_circa_ 2980-2750 B.C.) which he had brought\nhome from excavations made at a cemetery near Meydum, Upper Egypt. The\nreport upon them forms part of the "_Historical Studies_," Vol. II.,\nof the _British School of Archæology in Egypt_.\n\nWhen Mr. Ling Roth suggested that some of the examples of Egyptian\nMummy cloths in Bankfield Museum should be examined on similar lines,\ndescribing the construction of the fabrics and yarns, together with\nthe characteristics of the fibres used, I undertook to carry out the\nwork and forward to him the results for permanent reference.\n\nEach of the fifteen cloths submitted was first examined by mounting\nabout 3/4" × 5/8" (20 mm. × 16 mm.) of the cloth on 3" × 1" (76 mm. ×\n25 mm.) glass slips, and covering with thin glass, so as to find out\nits plan of composition and the number of warp and weft threads per\nlinear inch. Afterwards, a little of the warp threads as well as of\nthe weft, was untwisted and the fibres separated, and these mounted\napart on another 3" × 1" slip (76 × 25 mm.), so that the kind of\ntextile fibre used and the diameter of the fibres could be measured.\nThese microscopical preparations will be kept in Bankfield Museum, as\nthey may be of interest to microscopists in the locality.\n\nThe cloths are from three sources:--Nos. 1 and 2 being from the\nprivate collection of Dr. Wallis-Budge, who has given the specimens to\nBankfield Museum; Nos. 3 to 8 are from the old Meyer collection in the\nLiverpool Museum (unfortunately the origin of them is unknown); and\nthose marked 9 to 15 were taken from a mummy of the XXVI. Dynasty,\nbrought to this country by Lord Denbigh, and now also in the Liverpool\nMuseum.\n\nA.--Specimens of Mummy cloths from Theban Tombs date about B.C. 1400,\npresented by Dr. Wallis-Budge.\n\n    1. A plain "one-up-and-one-down" linen cloth. The yarns\n    in this example are more irregular in diameter than\n    usual--the warp strands varying from 1/25"th to 1/71"st\n    (1 mm. to ·2/8 mm.) The warp has about half its strands\n    doubled (that is twined together), whereas the weft has\n    only about one in twenty doubled. See Fig. 26.\n\n    2. This is a coarser fabric, has been dyed with\n    saffron, and is somewhat brittle to tease out the\n    fibres. Both these cloths had evidently absorbed some of\n    the gums or balsams used in the process of embalming,\n    and hence the difficulty of separating the fibres for\n    identification is increased. The structure of the fabric\n    is peculiar, and, indeed, the only instance I have seen\n    in Egyptian cloths. A portion, near the middle of the\n    piece sent, has the warp strands in pairs parallel to\n    each other, a few of them being double yarns, while all\n    the remainder are doubled. Of the weft, nearly half are\n    double yarns. See Fig. 27.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Magnified 10 diameters.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Magnified 10 diameters, showing the warp yarn\nin pairs.]\n\nB.--Specimens from the Meyer Collection, marked No. 11088. (Date of\nacquisition about 1856; date and place of origin unknown).\n\n    3. This is a beautifully soft, fine _Wool_ fabric,\n    containing no size or balsam. From the fineness of the\n    yarn and of the individual fibres I have no doubt that\n    the wool has been imported from India, or, more likely,\n    that the cloth was made in Cashmere. The texture is a\n    plain weave, has a selvedge edge, the warp yarns are\n    doubled, while the weft is single yarn. It is much to be\n    regretted that the particulars of locality, of burial,\n    and the period of time to which this interesting fabric\n    belongs has been lost. I assume from the general\n    characteristics that it is of a late period--probably\n    not earlier than the Ptolemaic.\n\n    4. This linen cloth has a plain selvedge, regular weave,\n    and contains no size. About 25% of both warp and weft\n    yarns are doubled, and all are very even in diameter.\n\n    5. A coarse linen cloth with plain selvedge. All the\n    yarns are single and even in diameter.\n\n    6. This is a coarse, highly-sized linen cloth. The yarns\n    are agglutinated, are brittle, and it is difficult to\n    separate the fibres. The sample submitted has been cut\n    from the end of the piece and shows the warp ends.\n\n    7. A coarse linen cloth, sized and brittle. No selvedge\n    on the piece sent. Both warp and weft yarns are single,\n    and even in diameter.\n\n    8. This is a very coarse linen fabric heavily sized and\n    brittle. Both warp and weft yarns are single and very\n    irregular in diameter.\n\nC.--Lord Denbigh\'s: XXVI. Dynasty.\n\n    9. A soft-spun linen cloth containing no size. Specimen\n    has been cut from the body of the fabric, showing no\n    selvedge. About half of the warp is composed of doubled\n    yarns of irregular diameter; the weft is of doubled\n    yarns and more regular in diameter.\n\n    10. The selvedge of this linen fabric is peculiar and\n    somewhat elaborate. The outer margin is composed of four\n    sets of ten yarns parallel to each other, forming one\n    strand of warp; then comes a space of 1-9/10" (48 mm.)\n    where the warp yarns are dyed red; then occurs three\n    more sets of ten parallel yarns (the object being to\n    strengthen the selvedge), followed by the general body\n    of the fabric. The entire selvedge is 2-1/4" (57 mm.)\n    wide. About half the warp yarns are doubled, while all\n    the weft are composed of doubled yarns, both being\n    fairly even in diameter, and not sized.\n\n    11. A fine, soft, linen cloth, with selvedge 1-1/8" (29\n    mm.) wide; the three outer and the two inner strands of\n    the warp are made up of many parallel yarns, as in No.\n    10, with an interspace of 3/8" (10 mm.) All the warp\n    yarns are dyed red, about 25% of them being doubled; the\n    weft is peculiar in having five or six strands of single\n    yarns alternating with six or seven double yarns, giving\n    a faint stripe in the fabric.\n\n    12. A linen cloth, with no selvedge edge. It has been\n    dyed red, probably _ferum_, a dye which I find uniformly\n    associated with friable or decomposing fibres.\n\n    13. A peculiarly coloured fine linen cloth; the pattern\n    is caused by some of the warp yarns being dyed, and\n    occurring sometimes of four, two, or one red strands,\n    with grey ones intermixed. A few of the warp yarns are\n    doubled. The weft is composed of single yarns and are\n    all in the grey.\n\n    14. A coarse soft-woven linen fabric, containing no\n    size. Lines are indicated at irregular distances along\n    the cloth, varying from 5/16" to 9/16" (8 to 14 mm.);\n    these are caused by the introduction of three strands of\n    doubled yarn in the warp while the remainder are single\n    yarns. The weft is all of doubled yarns; both warp and\n    weft are very regular in diameter.\n\n    15. This is a variegated linen fabric with warps\n    coloured something like No. 13, but the red strands of\n    warp are more irregular in distribution. Like it, a few\n    of the warp yarns are doubled, both the red and the\n    grey; while the weft is all of single yarns and in the\n    grey."\n\n[A considerable quantity of specimens of the cloths which were woven\nby the Ancient Egyptians has been examined both in this country and\nabroad. I may, however, call special attention to the results of\nexamination published in Miss M. A. Murray\'s excellent little work\n_The Tomb of Two Brothers_, Manchester Museum Publications, No. 68,\n1910.--H.L.R.]\n\n\nDETAILS OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE BODY WRAPPINGS.\n\n --------+-------+-----+-----++-----------------------------------------\n Specimen|Nature |Warp |Weft ||   Micro Measurements of Ten Fibres.\n    No.  |  of   |Ends |Picks|+-------------+-------------+-------------\n         |Textile|per  |per  ||    Weft.    |    Warp.    |  Mean of.\n         | Fibre.|inch.|inch.|+======+======+======+======+======+======\n         |       |     |     || Max. | Min. | Max. | Min. | Weft.| Warp.\n ========+=======+=====+=====++======+======+======+======+======+======\n         |       |     |     ||  in. |  in. |  in. |  in. |  in. |  in.\n A.   { 1| Linen |  44 | 32  ||1/1400|1/3333|1/1424|1/3330|1/1768|1/1786\n      { 2|   "   |  10 | 17  ||1/1786|1/3330|1/1780|1/2860|1/2020|1/1905\n         |       |     |     ||      |      |      |      |      |\n      { 3| Wool  | 224 | 40  ||1/833 |1/2500|1/833 |1/2000|1/1351|1/1429\n      { 4| Linen |  64 | 32  ||1/1429|1/2500|1/1250|1/5000|1/1818|1/1754\n      { 5|   "   |  56 | 20  ||1/1250|1/3333|1/1250|1/2500|1/1754|1/1724\n B.   { 6|   "   |  48 | 24  ||1/1250|1/2500|1/1000|1/2500|1/1640|1/1594\n      { 7|   "   |  48 | 20  ||1/1111|1/2500|1/1000|1/2500|1/1408|1/1428\n      { 8|   "   |  36 | 16  ||1/833 |1/3333|1/1111|1/2500|1/1456|1/1613\n         |       |     |     ||      |      |      |      |      |\n      { 9|   "   |  48 | 24  ||1/1666|1/3333|1/1666|1/3333|1/2222|1/1860\n      {10|   "   |  32 | 60  ||1/833 |1/3333|1/908 |1/3333|1/1724|1/1613\n      {11|   "   |  80 | 36  ||1/1429|1/3333|1/1000|1/3333|1/1887|1/1784\n C.   {12|   "   |  96 | 40  ||1/1111|1/2500|1/1250|1/2500|1/1724|1/1695\n      {13|   "   |  80 | 36  ||1/1111|1/2500|1/1429|1/2500|1/1640|1/2040\n      {14|   "   |  56 | 24  ||1/909 |1/3333|1/1250|1/2500|1/1594|1/1695\n      {15|   "   |  64 | 36  ||1/1250|1/2000|1/1429|1/2500|1/1724|1/1818\n --------+-------+-----+-----++------+------+------+------+------+------\n\n\nTHE ABOVE CONVERTED INTO METRICAL MEASUREMENTS.\n\n --------+-------+--------+--------++-----------------------------------\n         |       |        |        || Micro Measurements of Ten Fibres\n Specimen|Nature | Warp   | Weft   ||          in Millimetres.\n    No.  |  of   | Ends   | Picks  |+-----------+-----------+-----------\n         |Textile| per    | per    ||   Weft.   |   Warp.   | Mean of\n         | Fibre.| Centim.| Centim.|+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====\n         |       |        |        ||Max. |Min. |Max. |Min. |Weft.|Warp.\n ========+=======+========+========++=====+=====+=====+=====+=====+=====\n     1   | Linen |  17    |  12·6  ||·0181|·0076|·0178|·0076|·0144|·0142\n     2   |   "   |   4    |   6·7  ||·0142|·0076|·0143|·0089|·0126|·0133\n     3   | Wool  |  88    |  15·6  ||·0305|·0101|·0305|·0127|·0188|·0178\n     4   | Linen |  25    |  12·6  ||·0178|·0101|·0203|·0050|·0140|·0145\n     5   |   "   |  22    |   7·8  ||·0203|·0076|·0203|·0101|·0145|·0147\n     6   |   "   |  19    |   9·5  ||·0203|·0101|·0254|·0101|·0155|·0159\n     7   |   "   |  19    |   7·8  ||·0229|·0101|·0254|·0101|·0180|·0178\n     8   |   "   |  14·1  |   6·3  ||·0305|·0076|·0229|·0101|·0174|·0157\n     9   |   "   |  19    |   9·5  ||·0152|·0076|·0152|·0076|·0208|·0130\n    10   |   "   |  12·6  |  23·6  ||·0305|·0076|·0278|·0076|·0147|·0157\n    11   |   "   |  31·5  |  14·1  ||·0178|·0076|·0254|·0076|·0135|·0142\n    12   |   "   |  37·4  |  15·6  ||·0229|·0101|·0203|·0101|·0147|·0149\n    13   |   "   |  19    |  14·1  ||·0229|·0101|·0178|·0101|·0155|·0124\n    14   |   "   |  22    |   9·5  ||·0278|·0076|·0203|·0101|·0159|·0149\n    15   |   "   |  25    |  14·1  ||·0203|·0127|·0178|·0101|·0147|·0140\n --------+-------+--------+--------++-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----\n\nIt is very obvious they had no scale to work to.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[A] To the uninitiated I may explain that in a horizontal loom the\nplane of the warp is more or less parallel with that of the floor,\nwhile in an upright or vertical loom the plane of the warp is at right\nangles to that of the floor.\n\n[B] To avoid indistinctness through over reduction, I have endeavoured\nto keep all reproductions in this paper as large as possible, and\nthink I have succeeded in not losing any detail in the necessary\nreduction.\n\n[C] Hay\'s drawings are not published but can be seen in the Brit.\nMus., Add. MSS. No. 29823, Fol. 32.\n\n[D] Olafsson, to be referred to later on, remarks that while in Ovid\'s\ntime the _spathe_ was used for beating-in the weft, in Seneca\'s time\nthe weft was beaten in by a toothed instrument. In other words a\nweaver\'s comb--the embryo reed--had been introduced.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE GREEK LOOM.\n\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--A Bushongo weaver at work. From Torday and\nJoyce, _Notes Ethnographiques_, _Ann. du Congo_, p. 182.]\n\nWe have now to say a few words about an upright loom which differs\nvery materially from the Egyptian loom already described. Whether the\nhorizontal loom is a later product than the vertical loom, or was\nevolved from it, or whether both were independent inventions cannot be\ndiscussed here, but I may point out that there is an intermediate form\nbetween the two. It is doubtful as to whether this is a transition\nform. It was first brought to my notice by Mr. T. A. Joyce, as in use\namongst some negro peoples in Central Africa possessing an old, high\nand possibly introduced civilisation, and is figured in Messrs. Torday\nand Joyce\'s Notes _Ethnographiques ... Bakuba ... et Bushongo_\n(_Annales du Congo_) pp. 24 and 182. In this loom the warp is\nstretched between an upper beam and a lower beam at an angle of about\n90 degrees, and the weaver sits underneath at his work, Fig. 28. It is\nnot at all uncommon to meet with illustrations showing the warp\nstretched at an incline, and apart from the fact that in many the\nweavers are posing for illustration, and therefore, are most probably\nnot exactly in their natural positions, the tilted arrangement has\nthis advantage, namely, that the work of beating-in is improved by\nthe fall given to the "sword" which, with less exertion by the\nweaver, drives the weft home more effectively. In all these cases,\nhowever, the weaver sits or stands in front of the loom, but in the\ncase of the Bushongo the loom is tilted to such an extent that the\nweaver finds it more convenient to sit underneath the warp.\n\nThe discovery by Messrs. Alan Gardiner and N. de G. Davies of\nillustrations of Egyptian upright looms, confirms Wilkinson in his\nstatement and illustration that the Egyptians had this class of loom\nas well as the horizontal one. The vertical loom is found in Europe,\nAsia, Africa and America, and is, probably, ethnically as old if not\nolder than the horizontal loom.[E] But this Egyptian upright loom\ndiffers from another, the Greek, or Central European, or Scandinavian\nform of the upright loom, in having an upper and a lower beam so that\nthe warp is made taut between two beams, while in the Greek loom there\nis only _one_ beam. The warp hangs from this beam, the warp threads\nbeing made taut by means of weights attached at the lower ends.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 29a.--Illustration on a small lekythos of an\nAthenian girl at work on a tapestry loom, together with a full size\ntracing of the tapestry loom. British Museum. B.C. 500.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 29b.--Illustration of a Greek woman with a\ntapestry loom. From Stackelberg\'s _Graeber der Hellenen_, pl. xxxiii.]\n\nThe Greeks were, however, acquainted with the tapestry loom, for there\nexists in the British Museum a small lekythos with an illustration,\nFig. 29a, of such an article resting on the knees of a lady weaver.[F]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Greek woman at work on a loom. From C. Robert\nἘφ ἀρχ 1892, pl. xiii., p. 247. It is not possible to say from\nthis illustration whether this is a warp weighted loom or not.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Penelope at her loom. Illustration on an\nAthenian skyphos found in an Etruscan tomb at Chiusi, and at present\nin the museum there. The illustration is taken from _Monumenti d.\nInst. Archeologico_, IX., pl. xlii.]\n\nIt has been described by Mr. H. B. Walters in _Jour. Hellenic\nStudies_, XXXI., 1911, p. 15, who says: "In front of her, Fig. 29a, is\na white wool basket (_Kalathos_) and on her lap is a frame somewhat in\nthe form of a lyre, being formed by two upright pieces with knobs at\nthe top, diverging slightly towards the top, across between which are\nstretched two threads at the top and two at the bottom, seven vertical\nthreads being also visible. Her hands are placed on the threads, which\nshe is engaged in manipulating. This object can only be intended for a\nhand loom, though there is apparently no evidence for the use of such\nobjects in ancient times or among Oriental races either in the past or\nthe present day. The only other parallel to the representation on this\nvase is one published by Stackelberg, Fig. 29b, where a woman holds a\nsimilar frame and is similarly occupied with her hands. The writers of\nthe articles _Sticken_ in Baumeister and _Phrygium Opus_ in Daremberg\nand Saglio, misled by the likeness of the object to the modern\ncrewel-frame, interpret the process as embroidery. But this kind of\nwork implies cloth or other textile substance already woven, on which\npatterns are worked in, whereas in both vase paintings the textile is\nobviously in course of construction." He is right in so far as he\ngoes, but both representations are those of _tapestry_ looms which\nfact is indicated by the warp threads in both cases, and by the design\nmarked on the warp threads of Fig. 29b--a method of preparing their\nwork in use to this day by tapestry weavers. Some authorities consider\nthat tapestry weaving is more closely related to mat making than to\ntrue weaving. In other words, I take it tapestry is an early stage in\nthe development of weaving. From this we get some idea as to how far\nthe Greeks had progressed in the textile arts.\n\nAs pointed out by MM. Daremberg and Saglio, _Dic. des Antiquités\nGrecques et Romaines_ pt. 46, p. 164, "illustrations of Greek or Roman\nmethods of weaving are very rare, they are much reduced and in so far\nas the art is concerned purely diagrammatic." On the other hand if\nthere are numerous references in the texts of classic authors, these\nreferences seem rather to obscure than elucidate the method of\nworking. However, there are three illustrations--the Penelope loom,\nFig. 31, and two Boeotian looms, one of which is illustrated in Fig.\n15--quite sufficient to explain the principle of the upright loom as\nused with warp weights by the Greeks, and the discovery of numerous\narticles, considered to be the warp weights, confirm the illustration.\n\nThe principle is the same throughout, viz.: the looms are vertical,\nthere is a warp beam on top, there are two cross rods one of which is\na laze rod and _possibly_ the other is a heddle; and the warp threads\nare all kept taut by means of attached weights. On one of the Boeotian\nlooms a bobbin or spool is shown. Along the top of Penelope\'s loom\nthere are indications of nine pegs, on six of which balls of coloured\nthread have been placed, evidently for working out the designs, very\nmuch the same as shown on the rug loom in Bankfield Museum already\nreferred to. The warp weights on this Athenian illustration are\ntriangular in shape, and perhaps resemble the pyramidic weights found\nin Egypt and attributed to Roman times. Assuming these pyramids are\nRoman warp weights it would appear that both Greeks and Romans had\nvertical looms on which the warp threads were kept taut by means of\nweights. In one of the few clearly expressed technical classical\nreferences, Seneca speaks of the warp threads stretched by hanging\nweights.\n\nIn the above classical illustrations which are after all only rough\ndiagrams, the warp weights appear to hang from a _single_ thread only,\nbut this can not have been correct. The warp threads must have been\nbunched, because a single suspended thread with a tension weight\nimmediately begins to unravel, and so loses the advantage of its\nhaving been spun, as any one can ascertain for oneself. As regards the\nsame point on the Lake Dwellers looms, Cohausen was the first to\nsurmise that the warp threads were bunched to receive the weight, and\nMessikommer proved it by practical experiment.[G]\n\nAs can be surmised with this class of loom the weaving begins at the\n_top_, working _down_wards, and the beating-in of the weft is\n_up_wards--the exact opposite to the method adopted with other\nlooms--for the pendant warp ends, although weighted to keep them taut,\ndo not appear to have been further fixed in position, so that to\ncommence weaving at the lower end made the operation so extremely\ndifficult as to be almost impossible.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Illustration of a Scandinavian warp weighted\nloom in the Copenhagen Museum. The illustration is taken from\nMontelius\' _Civilisation of Sweden in Heathen Times_, translated by\nthe Rev. F. H. Woods, London, Macmillan & Co., 1888, p. 160.\n\n[In the illustration of this loom published by the Trustees of the\nBritish Museum, in their _Guide to the Antiquities of the Early Iron\nAge_, London, 1905, p. 139, the shape of the warp weights has been\naltered to suit the shape of such weights in the British Museum\ncollections.]]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Icelandic Loom after Olafsson.\n\n_a a_ Beam on which the warp is fixed. _b b_ Weights to make the warp\ntaut. _c c_ Brackets which support the beam and on which it can be\nrevolved by means of the spoke _e_ when the warp has to be lengthened,\non account of the weft _f_ working downwards and so shortening the\nfinished portion of the woven cloth. _g_ A sharp bone or tough piece\nof wood to beat the weft into proper position. _h_ The wound up weft\nwhich is pushed through the warp with the fingers. _i i_ The unbeamed\nwarp. _k k_ The heddles or shed openers. _l l_ The supports on which\nthe heddles rest when the "pick" is made [_i.e._, the pushing the weft\nthrough]. _m_ The beater-in. _n_ and _o_ Laze rods. _q_ The template\nfor regulating the width of the cloth. _r r_ and _s s_ Beam on to\nwhich the loom is fixed.\n\nSome of the descriptions are not as clear as could be wished.

Annandale mentions that\nhe obtained in the Faroes a beater-in made of a whale\'s jaw or rib;\nwhile in Iceland he saw some of the perforated stones to which the\nwarp threads were attached (_The Faroes and Iceland_, Oxford, 1905,\npp. 195-6).]\n\nThe Scandinavian form of the "Greek" loom from the Faroes Fig. 32, is\nmade known to us through the article itself in the Copenhagen Museum,\nillustrated by Montelius, _Civilisation of Sweden in Heathen Times_,\nLond. 1888, p. 160, and through the very clear illustration and\ndescription given us by Olafsson in his _Oeconomische Reise durch\nIsland_, 1787, translated from the Danish edition of 1780. The loom\nfigured by Olafsson, Fig. 33, shows an advance on that of Montelius,\nin being provided with heddles.[H] Upright looms with a lower beam\ninstead of with warp weights and furnished with heddles, are not\nuncommon. There are the well known Indian and Persian rug looms, and\nDu Chaillu figures one in his _Journey to Ashango Land_, London, 1867,\nplate facing p. 291. Randall-Maciver and Wilkin illustrate a vertical\nloom in use among the Kabyles, _Libyan Notes_, London, 1901, Pl. IX.,\nand although the details of the illustration are not clear the text\nindicates the existence of one heddle: "The warp is decussated by\nmeans of a horizontal rod and leashes." Dr. Washington Mathews figures\nseveral Navajo looms with heddles, _Third Ann. Rep. Bureau of\nEthnology_, p. 291; Ancient Peruvians also used them, as shown by Dr.\nMax Schmidt, _Baessler Archiv, I. pt. 1_, and so on practically _ad.\nlib._ But to work an upright warp-weighted loom with heddles is\nattended with great practical inconvenience, and this difficulty has,\nno doubt, been one of the chief causes of the complete discardance of\nthis class of loom.\n\nIn spite of the evidence in favour of the existence of warp weighted\nlooms, the Director of the Hermannstadt Museum, Dr. v.\nKimakovicz-Winnicki, sees fit to deny their existence. He found that\nin some parts of Transylvania the peasants use wooden pyramids (see\nFig. 18) similar to the Roman warp weights for winding the thread\nfrom the spindle on to the shuttle. For this purpose sockets are\nbored into the thin or top end of two pyramids, which are placed\njust so far apart that a spindle can rest horizontally with one end\nin the socket of one pyramid, and the other end of the spindle in\nthe socket of the other pyramid, and the thread in being wound off\non to the shuttle causes the spindle to revolve in the sockets. From\nthis he argues that what we have hitherto taken to be warp weights\nare not warp weights at all (_Spinn-u. Webewerkzeuge_, Wuerzburg,\n1911), and having denied these articles to be warp weights he gets\nover the difficulty presented by the illustration of Penelope at her\nloom, by attempting to prove that what we take to be a loom is no\nloom at all but a _flechtrahm_, _i.e._ plaiting frame! He then\nattempts to pull to pieces the idea that the Scandinavian loom in\nthe Copenhagen Museum is a loom and condemns it as unworkable. There\ncan be no doubt about his meaning as he defines his terms. The\nprinciple of weaving (_Weben_) he describes "as the absorption of\ntwo groups of parallel material elements (warp and weft) at right\nangles to each other, and the principle of plaiting (_Flechten_) as\nthe absorption by itself in one plane of one group only of material\nelement, (warp)" and he gives diagrammatic illustrations showing\nclearly what he means (_op. cit._ p. 31).[I] Judging from his\nremarks one must conclude he has not seen a primitive loom of any\nsort, and were it not for the official position he holds, his\nremarks would not need answering.\n\nIt has, I believe, been suggested more than once that some of the\nperforated stones, pieces of burnt clay, pieces of chalk and like\nobjects may be and are net-sinkers, and there is some justification\nfor Dr. Kimakovicz-Winnicki\'s statement that the pyramidic forms are\nnot warp weights; but it does not follow that all the perforated\narticles are either spindle-holders or net-sinkers, yet that is what\nhis subsequent statements lead one to infer. It is, however, difficult\nto prove that these perforated articles are warp weights.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Side view and section of chalk warp weight\nfound at Great Driffield. Of three of the weights the following\ndimensions were taken:\n\n    7-3/4" (19·7 cm.) long,   2 lbs. 3 oz. (1·0 k)\n    6"     (15·2  " )   "     1 lb.  8 oz.

(0·6 k)\n\nHull Museum.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 35.--"Chalk weight, 6" × 4" × 2" (15·2 cm. × 10·2\n× 5·1), similar to those found in pits, at Mount Caburn and Cissbury\nnear Worthing, Sussex. Found with eighteen more in the _filling_ of\npit 7, Winkelbury Hill." _Excavations in Winkelbury Camp_, by\nLieut.-Gen. Pitt-Rivers (_Excavations in Cranbourne Chase_, Vol. II.,\n1888). As Pitt-Rivers also found at Winkelbury the fragment of a comb\nand a chalk spindle whorl, which are textile tools, we may safely\npresume these fashioned pieces of chalk are warp weights.]\n\nIn 1875 several flat irregular oblong perforated pieces of soft chalk\nwere found in enlarging the cattle market in Great Driffield,\nYorkshire; they were found in a hole about three feet deep with\nAnglo-Saxon potsherds, animal remains, and bits of iron. They can now\nbe seen in the Mortimer Collection in the Hull Museum. They consist of\npieces of chalk, similar to those which drop annually in thousands\nupon thousands down the cliffs from the boulder clay between\nBridlington and Flamborough. On some a shoulder has been cut, Fig. 34,\nmost have one perforation, but in a few specimens, where the thin\nportion above the hole has been broken off, a second hole has been\nmade. None of them can stand unsupported. Owing to the soluble nature\nof the chalk they could not have been used as net-sinkers in the sea\n(about nine miles off) for they would quickly dissolve in salt water,\nand the same holds good in regard to fresh water, although in a lesser\ndegree. But I do not think they were used even in fresh water as\nnet-sinkers, for it was a characteristic of primitive peoples, with\nwhom time was of no account, to do their work thoroughly--what they\nmade was intended to last, and chalk net-sinkers would not have\nlasted. That these were found in a limited quantity, I believe about\nseventeen in number, tends to show that they are warp weights, for\nonly a few are required for every loom, in spite of the considerable\nnumber shown in the non-technical illustration of Penelope\'s loom. Not\nbeing able to find any other use for these pieces of chalk, and\njudging that they are suitable for the purpose, I should say they are\nwarp weights. In this case the weaver has made the most of what nature\nhas given him; in other parts of England he has had to fashion the\nweight out of the rough chalk, Fig. 35.\n\nIn the Museum at Devizes there are several hard pieces of perforated\nand fashioned chalk which offer more conclusive evidence. Of these\nMrs. M. E. Cunnington, the Curator, writes me: "All the weights here\nhave holes bored right through. Two large ones stand easily on the\nfloor. Others are more irregular in form and will not stand upright.\nThis latter type is, as far as I am aware, the more usual in this part\nof the country. They are commonly cut out of the hard chalk, and weigh\nabout 3 or 4 lbs. (1·5-2 Kilos). We think these weights are loom\nweights because we find them with Romano-British remains, as at\nWestbury, and late Celtic remains on our chalk uplands, far from water\nwhere fishing could have been carried on. With the same remains we\nfind weaving combs, numerous spindle whorls and other tools of bone\nthat were also probably used in weaving operations." The Westbury, in\nWiltshire, referred to, is some thirty miles in a straight line from\nthe mouth of the Severn, and about forty miles from the English\nChannel. These pieces of chalk cannot therefore have been used as\nnet-sinkers, leaving out of consideration their composition; they were\nfound with weaving tools and they fit the position. So far the\ningenuity of our ablest archæologists at home and abroad has not\nsucceeded in ascribing the use of these objects to anything else than\nnet-sinking or warp tension. The adaptability of the articles for use\nas warp weights, the small groups in which they are found, the\ndiscovery of weaving implements in the closest proximity, our\nknowledge of the Greek representations of warp-weighted looms, the\nOlafsson illustration, and the loom in the Copenhagen Museum all tend\nto prove that these articles are really warp weights.\n\nAs regards the practical possibility or impossibility of working a\n"Greek" loom, I had a simple frame made in the Museum and showed Mr.\nJ. Smith, a mill "Overlooker" at Messrs. Wayman and Sons, Ld.,\nHalifax, the illustration in Montelius\' book already referred to, and\nasked him to weave me a small piece of cloth on it. In the course of a\nfew hours he did the warping, beaming and weaving, making the pick\nwith his fingers and using a ball of weft thread instead of a spool or\nshuttle. The result is shown in the accompanying illustration, Fig.\n36, conclusively proving that weaving on such a frame is quite\nfeasible, and practically proving that Olafsson\'s and the Copenhagen\nwarp weighted looms are properly constructed workable looms.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--A warp weighted loom made at Bankfield\nMuseum, to show the possibility of weaving by this method. There is no\nheddle nor shuttle used. The weaver made the "shed" and pushed the\nweft through with his fingers. He naturally worked _down_wards.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Diagram to show how the warp is kept taut on\na Syrian loom.]\n\nFinally, it may not be out of place here to point out that there are\nother looms, besides the Greek and Scandinavian, on which the warp is\nmade taut by means of warp weights. The Rev. Dr. Harvey Porter, of the\nAmerican College, Beyrout, Syria, writing about the year 1901, thus\ndescribes the common loom of the country. He says: "Two upright posts\nare fixed in the ground, which hold the roller to which the threads of\nthe warp are fastened, and upon which the cloth is wound as it is\nwoven. The threads of the warp are carried upward towards the ceiling\nat the other end of the room, and pass over rollers, and are gathered\nin hanks and weighted to keep them taut (_Dic. of the Bible_,\nEdinburgh, 1902, IV., p. 901)." He has kindly sent me an illustration\nof this loom, but unfortunately the weights are not clearly shown, and\nthe same is the case with an illustration of a loom from Cyprus.[J]\nThe diagram, Fig. 37, shows the principle. In a Shan loom illustrated\nby Mrs. Leslie Milne, in _The Shans at Home_, London, 1910, p. 120,\nthe warp makes a somewhat similar detour over the head of the weaver,\nit is, however, not weighted but tied to a beam. The point to be\nobserved is that these warp-weighted looms are horizontal and not\nperpendicular, and also that the weaving is the reverse of that on the\nGreek loom but similar to that on our horizontal looms, so that the\npresent Syrian and Cyprian looms have nothing in common with the old\nGreek loom.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Hand of Penelope clutching her shuttle. From\na corner of a piece of sculpture discovered by O. Kern and described\nby C. Robert, (_The Feet Washing of Odysseus_, fifth Century B.C.,\n_Mitt. Kais. Deutsch. Arch. Inst._, Athens, XXV., 1900, pp. 332-3).\nThe author considers Penelope to be in the act of unravelling what she\nhas woven: "We see her holding the spool with her right hand, while\nthe left hand, half closed, is raised to about shoulder high, and the\nfingers, if I read the traces correctly, are posed as though she held\na thread."]\n\nThe Greeks evidently used a spool in weaving, that is a piece of stick\nround which was wound the thread that became the weft, as is shown in\nthe hand of Penelope, Fig. 38, and in Kirke\'s loom, Fig. 15.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[E] I find frequent references, by various writers, to an upright loom\nmentioned by E. H. Palmer as used by a Bedawin woman near Jebel Musa,\nbut on looking up his description (_The Desert of the Exodus_, I. p.\n125), I find it to be so indifferent as to be quite useless for\npurposes of comparison.\n\n[F] My attention to this was kindly drawn by Mr. F. N. Pryce,\nAssistant in the Dept. of Greek and Roman Antiquities.\n\n[G] The existence of warp weighted looms amongst the prehistoric Lake\nDwellers of Switzerland was first surmised by Pauer (_Keller\'s Lake\nDwellings_) from the discovery of the weights, and was made\npractically certain by Messikommer and Jentsch.\n\n[H] Comparing the loom Olafsson saw with the description in the Nial\nSaga, he concludes this sort of loom was in use A.D. 1014, in the\nNorth of Scotland.\n\n[I] He criticises the detail of the illustration of Penelope\'s loom.\nIt must be remembered this illustration is not a technical drawing,\nbut an artist\'s representation where correctness of detail cannot be\nexpected. In his own drawing of the Egyptian horizontal loom many of\nthe warp threads are shown over instead of under the laze rods, and\nyet this is supposed to be a correct technical drawing!\n\n[J] Since writing Dr. Porter has sent me photograph of another sort of\nloom in which weights are used as counter balances to keep the heddles\nraised. The subject requires further elucidation.\n\n\n\n\nIII. CONCLUSION.\n\n\nFrom the foregoing we gather that the Ancient Egyptians had two forms\nof looms. The earlier or horizontal form, date about B.C. 2000, has in\na modified way survived to the present day in desert Egypt and is also\nfound in Seistan. It required a large area of ground for working and\nprobably in earlier times when there was plenty of space this did not\nmuch matter. But as the population in the towns increased and with\nthe increase of civilisation and its concomitant increased demand for\ncloth, probably out of proportion to the increase of population, space\nwould be begrudged and this may have caused the invention or the\nintroduction of the vertical form of loom which we find in use some\n500 years later. In Egypt therefore the horizontal loom preceded the\nvertical loom but it does not necessarily follow that such was the\ncase elsewhere. In so far as we can gather from the small amount of\ninformation at our disposal, in the earlier days the women were the\nweavers, and later on with the introduction of the upright loom the\nmen were the weavers with an occasional female weaver. In the Egyptian\nDesert and in Seistan in the present day with horizontal looms the\nweavers appear to be males, but among the nomads of Persia who\nlikewise use horizontal looms the weavers are females. In the use of\neither form of loom the Egyptian weavers beat the weft downwards or\ntowards themselves and _not_ upwards or away from themselves. They had\nthe heddle in one of its earliest forms and had consequently made the\nfirst great step in the evolution of the loom as we now know it. In\nthe beginning they made no selvedges so that for every pick a separate\nlength of weft thread was used. The adoption of the selvedge was\nanother improvement and until it was introduced the weft would no\ndoubt have been put through with the fingers, later on a spool being\nused. It is possible also that in very late times the weavers\' comb\nwas introduced. It is safe to say that the Egyptians had no knowledge\nof the reed. Both forms of looms were simple, without harness or other\ncomplicated pieces of mechanism. The Egyptians accomplished fairly\ngood work and judging these people from their looms alone we must\nconclude they were a progressive race.\n\nThe Greek form of loom was an upright one on which the warp threads\nwere kept taut by means of weights and similar to the form which\nexisted in Central and Northern Europe (in the latter until recent\ntimes) but of which so far there is no trace to the east, or south, or\nwest. The Greek loom may have been furnished with a heddle but the\ndrawings are not clear on this point. A spool was used. The weavers\nwere women and the weft was beaten upwards or away from the weaver. It\nwas not a form of loom so capable of improvement as the Egyptian forms\nand there appears to be no connection between the forms used on either\nside of the Mediterranean. The Greek tapestry loom could hardly have\nbeen more primitive. In respect to the forms of looms used by the two\npeoples the Egyptians were considerably in advance of the Greeks.\n\n\nFINIS.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber\'s Note\n\nPunctuation errors have been repaired.\n\nThe author uses some archaic and alternative spelling, for example,\nnooze for noose, gramms for grammes.

The investigations of that great\nphilosopher are so valuable, so full of instructions that we are led to\nreprint them, together with those of Mr. C. J. Burnett, on the salts of\nuranium, etc., as an Introduction.  It will be seen that the process by\nwhich blue prints are to-day obtained is exactly that Sir John Herschel\ndevised in 1840.\n\n“It is no longer an insulated and anomalous affection of certain salts of\nsilver or gold, but one which, doubtless, in a greater or less degree,\npervades all nature, and connects itself intimately with the mechanism by\nwhich chemical combination and decomposition is operated.  The general\ninstability of organic combinations might lead us to expect the occurrence\nof numerous and remarkable cases of this affection among bodies of that\nclass, but among metallic and other elements inorganically arranged,\ninstances enough have already appeared, and more are daily presenting\nthemselves, to justify its extension to all cases in which chemical\nelements may be supposed combined with a certain degree of laxity, and so\nto speak in a _tottering equilibrium_.  There can be no doubt that the\nprocess, in a great majority, if not in all cases, which have been noticed\namong inorganic substances, is a deoxidizing one, so far as the more\nrefrangible rays are concerned.  It is obviously so in the cases of gold\nand silver.  In the case of the bichromate of potash it is most probable\nthat an atom of oxygen is parted with, and so of many others.  A beautiful\nexample of such deoxidizing action on a non-argentine compound has lately\noccurred to me in the examination of that interesting salt, the\nferrosesquicyanuret of potassium described by Mr. Smee in the\n_Philosophical Magazine_, No. 109, September, 1840, and he has shown how\nto manufacture in abundance and purity, by voltaic action on the common or\nyellow ferrocyanuret.  In this process nascent oxygen is absorbed,\nhydrogen given off, and the characters of the resulting compound in\nrespect of the oxides of iron, forming as it does Prussian blue with proto\nsalts, indicate an excess of electro-negative energy, a disposition to\npart with oxygen, or which is the same thing, to absorb hydrogen (in the\npresence of moisture), and thereby to return to its pristine state, under\ncircumstances of moderate solicitation, such as the affinity of protoxide\nof iron (for instance) for an additional dose of oxygen, etc.”\n\n“Paper simply washed with a solution of this salt is highly sensitive to\nthe action of the light.  Prussian blue is deposited (the base being\nnecessarily supplied by the destruction of one portion of the acid, and\nthe acid by the destruction of another).  After half an hour or an hour’s\nexposure to sunshine, a very beautiful negative photograph is the result,\nto fix which, all that is necessary is to soak it in water in which a\nlittle sulphate of soda is dissolved.  While dry the impression is of a\ndove color or lavender blue, which has a curious and striking effect on\nthe greenish yellow ground of the paper produced by the saline solution.\nAfter washing the ground color disappears and the photograph becomes\nbright blue on a white ground.  If too long exposed, it gets\n‘over-sunned,’ and the tint has a brownish or yellowish tendency, which,\nhowever, is removed in fixing; but no increase of intensity beyond a\ncertain point is obtained by the continuance of exposure.”\n\n“If paper be washed with a solution of ammonio-citrate of iron and dried\nand then a wash passed over it of the yellow ferro-cyanuret of potassium,\nthere is no immediate formation of true Prussian blue, but the paper\nrapidly acquires a violet-purple color, which deepens after a few minutes,\nas it dries, to almost absolute blackness.  In this state it is a positive\nphotographic paper of high sensibility, and gives pictures of great depth\nand sharpness, but with this peculiarity, that they darken again\nspontaneously on exposure to the air in darkness, and are soon\nobliterated.  The paper, however, remains susceptible to light, and\ncapable of receiving other pictures, which in their turn fade, without any\npossibility (so far as I can see) of arresting them, which is to be\nregretted, as they are very beautiful, and the paper of such easy\npreparation.  If washed with ammonia or its carbonate, they are for a few\nmoments entirely obliterated, _but presently reappear with reversed lights\nand shades_.  In this state they are fixed, and the ammonia, with all that\nit will dissolve, being removed by washing in water, their color becomes a\npure Prussian blue, which deepens much by keeping.  If the solution be\nmixed there results a very dark violet-colored ink, which may be kept\nuninjured in an opaque bottle, and will readily furnish by a single wash\nat a moment’s notice the positive paper in question, which is most\nsensitive when wet.”\n\n“It seems at first sight natural to refer these curious and complex\nchanges to the instability of the cyanic compounds; and that this opinion\nis to a certain extent correct is proved by the photographic impressions\nobtained on papers to which no iron has been added beyond what exists in\nthe ferrocyanic salts themselves.  Nevertheless, the following experiments\nabundantly prove that in several of the changes above described, the\n_immediate action_ of the solar rays is not exerted on these salts, but on\nthe iron contained in the ferruginous solution added to them, which it\ndeoxidizes or otherwise alters, thereby presenting it to the ferrocyanic\nsalts in such a form as to precipitate the acids in combination with the\nperoxide, or protoxide of iron, as the case may be.  To make this evident,\nall that is necessary is _simply to leave out the ferrocyanate_ in the\npreparation of the paper, which thus becomes reduced to a simple washing\nover with the ammonio-citric solution.  Paper so washed is of a bright\nyellow color, and is apparently little, but in reality highly sensitive to\nphotographic action. Exposed to strong sunshine, for some time indeed, its\nbright yellow tint is dulled into an ochrey hue, or even to gray, but the\nchange altogether amounts to a moderate percentage of the total light\nreflected, and in short exposures is such as would easily escape notice.\nNevertheless, if a slip of this paper be held for only four or five\nseconds in the sun (the effect of which is quite imperceptible to the\neye), and when withdrawn into the shade be washed over with the\nferrosesquicyanate of potash, a considerable deposit of Prussian blue\ntakes place on the sunned part, and none whatever on the rest; so that on\nwashing the whole with water, a pretty strong blue impression is left,\ndemonstrating the reduction of iron in that portion of the paper to the\nstate of protoxide.  The effect in question is not, it should be observed,\npeculiar to ammonio-nitrate of iron.”\n\n“The ammonio and potasso-tartrate fully possess and the perchloride\n_exactly neutralized_ partakes of the same property; but the experiment is\nfar more neatly made and succeeds better with the other salts.”\n\n“The varieties of cyanotype processes seem to be innumerable, but that\nwhich I shall now describe deserves particular notice not only for its\npre-eminent beauty while in progress, but as illustrating the peculiar\npower of the ammoniacal and other parsalts of iron above-mentioned to\nreceive a latent picture susceptible of development by a great variety of\nstimuli.  This process consists in simply passing over the\nammonio-citrated paper on which such a latent picture has been impressed,\n_very sparingly and evenly_, a wash of the solution of the common yellow\nferrocyanate (prussiate) of potash.  The latent picture, if not so faint\nas to be quite invisible (and for this purpose it should not be so), is\nnegative.  As soon as the liquid is applied, which cannot be in too thin a\nfilm, the negative picture vanishes, and by very slow degrees is replaced\nby a positive one of a violet blue color on a greenish yellow ground,\nwhich at a certain moment possesses a high degree of sharpness and\nsingular beauty and delicacy of tint.  If at this instant it be thrown\ninto water, it passes immediately to a Prussian blue, losing, at the same\ntime, however, much of its sharpness, and sometimes indeed becoming quite\nblotty and confused.”\n\n“To prevent this confusion gum arabic may be added to the prussiated\nsolution, by which it is hindered from spreading unmanageably within the\npores of the paper, and the precipitated Prussian blue allowed time to\nagglomerate and fix itself on the fibers. By the use of this ingredient\nalso, a much thinner and more equal film may be spread over the surface,\nand _when perfectly dry_, if not sufficiently developed, the application\nmay be repeated. By operating thus I have occasionally (though rarely)\nsucceeded in producing pictures of great beauty and richness of effect,\nwhich they retain (if not thrown in water) between the leaves of a\nportfolio, and have a certain degree of fixity—fading in strong light and\nrecovering their tone in the dark. * * *”\n\n“If paper be washed with a mixture of the solutions of ammonio-citrate of\niron and ferrosesquicyanate (red prussiate) of potash, so as to contain\nthe two salts in about equal proportions, and being then impressed with a\npicture, be thrown into water and dried, a negative blue picture will be\nproduced.  This picture I have found to be susceptible of a very curious\ntransformation.  To effect this it must be washed with a solution of\nprotonitrate of mercury, which in a little time entirely discharges it.\nThe nitrate being thoroughly washed out and the picture dried, a smooth\niron is passed over it, somewhat hotter than is used for ironing linen,\nbut not sufficiently so to scorch or injure the paper.  The obliterated\npicture immediately reappears, not blue, but brown. If kept for some weeks\nin this state between the leaves of a portfolio, in complete darkness, it\nfades, and at length almost disappears.  But what is very singular, a\nfresh application of heat revives and restores it to its full intensity.”\n\n“This curious transformation is instructive in another way. It is not\noperated by light, at least not by light alone. _A certain temperature_\nmust be attained, and that temperature suffices in complete darkness.\nNevertheless, I find that on exposing to a very concentrated spectrum\n(collected by a lens of short focus) a slip of paper prepared as above\n(that is to say, by washing with the mixed solutions, exposure to\nsunshine, washing and discharging the uniform blue color so induced, as in\nthe last article), its whiteness is changed to a brown over the whole\nregion of the red and orange rays, _but not beyond_ the luminous spectrum.\nThree conclusions seem unavoidable: first—that it is the heat of these\nrays, not their light, which operates the change; second—that this heat\npossesses a peculiar chemical quality which is not possessed by the purely\ncalorific rays outside of the visible spectrum, though far more intense;\nand third—that the heat radiated from obscurely hot iron abounds\nespecially in rays analogous to those of the region of the spectrum above\nindicated.”\n\nSir John Herschel then proceeds to show that whatever be the state of the\niron in the double salts in question, its reduction by blue light to the\nstate of protoxide is indicated by many other agents.  “Thus, for\nexample,” says Robert Hunt, “if a slip of paper prepared with the\nammonio-citrate of iron be exposed partially to sunshine, and then washed\nwith the bichromate of potash, the bichromate is deoxidized and\nprecipitated upon the sunned portion, just as it would be if directly\nexposed to the sun’s rays.”\n\n“I have proved this fact with a great number of preparations of cobalt,\nnickel, bismuth, platinum and other salts which have been thought hitherto\nto be insensitive to the solar agency; but if they are partially sunned\nand then washed with nitrate of silver and put aside in the dark, the\nmetallic silver is slowly reduced upon the sunned portion.  In many\ninstances days were required to produce the visible picture; and in one\ncase paper being washed in the dark with neutral chloride of platinum was\nsunned and then washed in the dark with nitrate of silver; it was some\nweeks before the image made its appearance, but it was eventually\nperfectly developed, and, when quite so, remained permanently impressed\nupon the paper.”\n\nThe following process, discovered at the same time as the cyanotype, and\ntermed chrysotype, is thus described by Sir John Herschel:\n\n“In order to ascertain whether any portion of the iron in the double\nammoniacal salt employed has really undergone deoxidation, I had recourse\nto a solution of gold, exactly neutralized by carbonate of soda.  The\nproto-salts of iron, as is well known to chemists, precipitate gold in the\nmetallic state.  The effect proved exceedingly striking, and, as the\nexperiment will probably be repeated by others, I shall here describe it\nab initio.  Paper is to be washed with a moderately concentrated solution\nof ammonio-citrate of iron and dried.  The strength of solution should be\nsuch as to dry into a good yellow color, not at all brown.  In this state\nit is ready to receive a photographic image, which may be impressed on it\neither from nature in the camera obscura, or from an engraving on a frame\nin sunshine.  The image so impressed is, however, very faint, and\nsometimes hardly perceptible.  The moment it is removed from the frame or\ncamera, it must be washed over with a neutral solution of chloride of gold\nof such strength as to have about the color of a sherry wine.  Instantly\nthe picture appears, not, indeed, at once of its full intensity, but\ndarkening with great rapidity up to a certain point, depending on the\nstrength of the solutions used, etc.  At this point nothing can surpass\nthe sharpness and perfection of detail of the resulting photograph.  To\narrest this process and to fix the picture (so far at least as the further\nagency of light is concerned), it is to be thrown into water very slightly\nacidulated with sulphuric acid, and well soaked, dried, washed with\nhydrobromate of potash, rinsed and dried again. * * *”\n\n“In point of _direct_ sensibility, the chrysotype paper is certainly\ninferior to the calotype; but it is one of the most remarkable\npeculiarities of gold as a photographic ingredient, that _extremely feeble\nimpressions once made by light go on afterwards, darkening spontaneously\nand very slowly, apparently without limit so long as the least vestige of\nunreduced chloride of gold remains in the paper_.  To illustrate this\ncurious and (so far as applications go) highly important property, I shall\nmention incidentally the results of some experiments made during the late\nfine weather on the habitudes of gold in presence of oxalic acid.  It is\nwell known to chemists that this acid, heated with solutions of gold,\nprecipitates the metal in its metallic state; it is upon this property\nthat Berzelius has founded his determination of the atomic weight of gold.\nLight, as well as heat, also operates this precipitation; but to render it\neffectual, several conditions are necessary:—First—the solution of gold\nshould be neutral, or at most _very_ slightly acid; secondly—the oxalic\nacid must be added in the form of a neutral oxalate; and thirdly—it must\nbe present in a certain considerable quantity, which quantity must be\ngreater the greater the amount of free acid present in the chloride.\nUnder this condition, the gold is precipitated by light as a black powder\nif the liquid be in any bulk; and if merely washed over paper, a stain is\nproduced, which, however feeble at first, under a certain dosage of the\nchloride, oxalate and free acid, goes on increasing from day to day and\nfrom week to week, when laid by in the dark and especially in a damp\natmosphere, till it acquires almost the black of ink; the unsunned portion\nof the paper remaining unaffected, or so slightly as to render it almost\ncertain that what little action of the kind exists is due to the effect of\ncasual dispersed light incident in the preparation of the paper.  I have\nbefore me a specimen of paper so treated in which the effect of thirty\nseconds’ exposure to sunshine was quite invisible at first, and which is\nnow of so intense a purple as may be well called black, while the unsunned\nportion has acquired comparatively but a slight brown.  And (what is not a\nlittle remarkable, and indicates that in the time of exposure mentioned\nthe _maximum_ of effect was attained) other portions of the same paper\nexposed in graduated progression for longer times, viz., one minute, two\nminutes, and three minutes, are not in the least perceptible degree darker\nthan the portion on which the light has acted during thirty seconds only.”\n\n“If paper prepared as above recommended for the chrysotype, either with\nthe ammonio-citrate or ammonio-tartrate of iron, and impressed, as in that\nprocess, with a latent picture, be washed with nitrate of silver instead\nof a solution of gold, a very sharp and beautiful picture is developed of\ngreat intensity.  Its disclosure is not instantaneous; a few moments\nelapse without apparent effect; the dark shades are then first touched in,\nand by degrees the details appear, but much more slowly than in the case\nof gold. In two or three minutes, however, the maximum of distinctness\nwill not fail to be obtained.  The picture may be fixed by the\nhyposulphite of soda, which alone, I believe, can be fully depended on for\nfixing argentic photographs.”\n\n“The best process for fixing the photographs prepared with gold is as\nfollows: As soon as the picture is satisfactorily brought out by the\nauriferous liquid, it is to be rinsed in spring water, which must be three\ntimes renewed, letting it remain in the third water five or ten minutes.\nIt is then to be blotted off and dried, after which it is to be washed on\nboth sides with a somewhat weak solution of hydriodate of potash.  If\nthere be any free chloride of gold present in the pores of the paper it\nwill be discolored, the lights passing to a ruddy brown; but they speedily\nwhiten again spontaneously, or at all events on throwing it (after lying a\nminute or two) into fresh water, in which, being again rinsed and dried,\nit is now perfectly fixed.”\n\nAs the chrysotype will be no more referred to, we shall state, first, that\nthe image can be developed with a plain solution of silver nitrate or one\nacidified with citric or any other organic acid, which generally gives a\nbrown impression that can be toned with an acid or alkaline gold bath, the\ncolor varying with the solution employed; and secondly, that the process\nmay be employed to obtain outlines of any picture on paper or canvas to be\ncolored in oil-paints.  The impression developed with gold terchloride is\npale blue, _quite permanent_, and does not at all interfere with the work\nof the artist.  The canvas should first be washed with a mixture of\nalcohol and aqueous ammonia, then dried and rubbed with pumice stone\npowder to give a _tooth_.  The modus operandi suggests itself.\n\nThe researches of Mr. C. J. Burnett on the application of uranium salts\nand other compounds to photography are recorded in the _Photographic\nNotes_ of Ths. Sutton for 1857.  We give in the following lines the most\ninteresting parts of the two papers of Mr. Burnett:\n\n* * * “The next class of processes are dependent on the sensitiveness to\nlight of the salts of uranic oxide or sesquioxide of uranium, U2O3.”\n\n“In the first process, the paper being charged with the uranic salt and\nexposed to the solar influence under the negative to be copied, is washed\nwith a solution of the ferridcyanide or red prussiate of potash.  The\n‘Harvest Scene’ in the exhibition, being from an albumen negative lent me\nby Mr. Ross, the well-known Edinburgh photographer, is an example, the\nsalt of the sesquioxide of uranium being in this case the hydrofluate, and\nthe time of exposure from the strength of the albumen negative fully an\nhour of good sunshine.  I have used for the solution of the uranic oxide\nfor this process a variety of acids with very similar results; the\nsensitiveness of the prepared paper to light varying much, however.  For\ninstance, a collodion negative with the hydrofluate paper producing a very\ngood print in half an hour of unsteady sun, while with a paper prepared\nwith the tartaric acid solution of the oxide, it gave an equally good\nimpression in less than five minutes of the same intermitting sunshine,\nindicating thus a difference of sensitiveness of six to one in favor of\nthe tartrate.”\n\n“The rationale of this process is the reduction of the sesqui-oxide of\nuranium, U2O3, on those parts of the paper exposed to the solar influence,\nto a lower state of oxidation, the photo-oxide UO, the salts of which have\nthe property of forming with soluble alkaline ferridcyanides a rich\nchocolate-brown precipitate, while the salts of the sesquioxide are\ndestitute of this reaction.  Hence the brown deposit on the parts of the\npicture on which the sun has been allowed to act when the developing\nsolution is applied, and the absence of any such appearance on those parts\nwhich have been protected from its influence.”\n\n“As to the manipulatory details of this process, the paper is floated on\nthe solution in a dark room and hung up to dry, and then preserved from\nlight in a portfolio.  If carefully secluded from light it appears to keep\nwell.  After exposure for the proper time under this negative, there is in\nsome cases scarcely any visible impression; while in other cases,\nparticularly when using the tartaric solution, I have found the impression\nvery distinguishable, of a brownish or blackish shade, although still\nquite faint.  The development is best conducted by floating it, anything\nlike rubbing the picture being very objectionable.”\n\n“When the picture has fully come out, which is generally from three to ten\nminutes at the very most, it is removed from the developing bath, placed\nin cold water and washed very gently for a few minutes, the water being\nfrequently changed till it ceases to acquire a yellow tinge from the\ndissolved red prussiate.  The picture is then drained from the water,\npressed between folds of blotting paper, dried (I dry in the dark), and\nthe process is complete. * * * I may state, as one recommendation of this\nprocess to ladies and other lovers of clean hands, that any brown stains\nleft by it on the fingers or elsewhere are at once removable by a little\nweak ammonia or soap and water. * * * I would particularly suggest, as\ndeserving of notice, the development of the salts of sesquioxide of\nuranium, and still more iron, by the metals and metallic-cyanic alkaline\nsalts, as also by the mellonides and nitro-prussides, and the latter also\nby itself and as developed by many metallic salts.”\n\n“I have since had the opportunity of trying the nitro-prusside of sodium,\nwhich, by itself, gives a blue and white picture, in color like that\nobtained from the red prussiate of potash.”\n\n“When mixed with a solution of ammonio-nitrate of copper, previous to its\napplication to the paper, the color obtained is pale purplish pink or\npeach-blossom color. By mixing it in the same way with ammonio-oxalate of\nsesquioxide of iron, we get a dull green picture, changeable through\nintermediate stages into brown by alkaline carbonates, and that into a\n_dirty_ black by gallic acid.  It may be well to know that the blue of the\npicture given by the red prussiate in the process of Sir John Herschel may\nbe considerably modified or entirely changed to another color, in many\nways, without interfering with the purity of the white ground, by steeping\nthe picture, after the undecomposed red prussiate has been washed out, in\nsolution of salts of various metals, copper, uranium or cobalt, for\ninstance, and that the colors so produced may be modified as desired,\naccording to the stage at which the action is stopped.”\n\n“There remains but one class of uranic photographs to be described,\nnamely, that obtained when we develop with a salt of silver or gold (or\nplatinum?).  This class may be made to print much more rapidly than our\nordinary silver printing process, approaching sometimes more nearly to the\ncalotype development in this respect.  We get the _minutest details_ with\ngreat fidelity, and the picture is effectually fixed by a simple fresh\nhyposulphite solution, with a good color in many cases, or by ammonia,\nwhich will be considered an advantage by those who hold the hyposulphite\nan enemy to durability.  Different shades of color are produced according\nto different solvent acids and different details.  I have got a good black\nperfectly like that of an engraving, by the nitrate of uranic oxide,\ndeveloped by ammonio-nitrate of silver (or plain nitrate) and fixed by\nplain hyposulphite without any coloring bath. * * * I have tried the\nhyposulphite of gold on some of the silver-developed prints prepared with\nthe hydrofluate of the uranic oxide and fixed with ammonia, which had an\nexceedingly unpleasant raw-red color, a very agreeable gray was at once\nobtained.  I have succeeded in getting very beautiful impressions by\ndevelopment of the uranic paper by chloride of gold alone.”\n\nIn another communication to the _Photographic Notes_, more interesting\nperhaps than the foregoing, Mr. Burnett says:\n\n“The clearest and brightest of my results have been obtained by the action\nof gallic acid, tannin, or especially a _mixture of tannin and carbonate\nof ammonia_, potash or soda, on the blue pictures obtained by the\nsolarization of paper prepared with ferridcyanide of potassium,\nferrocyanide or ferridcyanide of ammonium. * * * I have also experimented\nwith the bichromate and iron, with gallic, tannin and other developer; but\nI must confess to not having been, in this particular way, so successful\nas Mr. Sella appears to have been in the preservation of the whites, owing\npossibly to my not having taken the trouble to wash out sufficiently the\niron before toning.”(1)\n\n“I have experimented most extensively in many ways with the chromates and\nbichromates, and have succeeded in various ways in getting _very good_\nresults.  A very capital process for many purposes is to float or steep\nyour paper in a mixed solution of bichromate of potash and sulphate of\ncopper.  As for E. Hunt’s chromotype process,” (2) I have mixed gelatine,\nor occasionally grape sugar, or both, with the solution, but instead of\ndeveloping it by a silver solution, as in the chromotype, wash out the\nsalts unacted on by light, and develop by floating on a solution of\nferrocyanide of potassium.  The color of the red copper salt which now\nforms the picture may be modified or changed in many ways, viz., by\nsoaking the picture, after the ferrocyanide of potassium has been washed\nout of the lights, in a solution of sulphate of iron (or the iron salt\nmay, but not so advantageously, have been applied to the picture before\nthe application of the ferrocyanide).  Solutions of chloride of tin,\ngallic and tannic acids, alone or with alkalies or alkaline carbonates,\nmay also be employed to modify or change the color.  Instead of developing\nby ferrocyanide you may develop by the cobalt or chromo-cyanogen salts, or\nby an alkaline _mellonide_ arsenite, etc.  Sulphureted hydrogen, or a\nsulphide, will give a _brown_, or _black_ tone, which may be protected\nagainst oxygen and dampness by a resinous varnish.\n\n“Of all the simple pictures obtainable with bichromated papers, without\ncomplications or other tonings, those obtainable by the combination of a\nsalt (say the sulphate) of _manganese_, with the bichromate in the paper\npreparation, are about the best; these pictures being, however, capable of\nbeing toned and modified in many different ways if desired.  This may be\naccomplished by the use of toning baths of ferridcyanide or ferrocyanide,\nor other metal cyanogen salts, etc., or by either mixing the salts of\nother metals, as copper or iron, with the cyanic toning baths, or using\nthem in the original solution, or by soaking the paper in them, as in\nSella’s process, previously to the application of the metal cyanic,\nmellonic or other toning baths.  Alkalies and alkaline carbonates may also\nbe used to remove the chromic acid, and leave a subsalt, or the very\nstable oxide or carbonate of manganese, which may be peroxidized by the\nuse of chloride of lime, peroxide of hydrogen, or ozone.”\n\n“In all the processes with metallic salts, alone with bichromates, the use\nof sized or unsized paper along with gelatine, etc., has some advantages.\nI have got good results by such processes on albumen paper, the albumen\ntending to prevent mealiness in the print; also on paper soaked in\ngelatine before the application of the bichromic solution. * * * There is\ngreat interest connected with the action of all such papers, along with\nthe tannin and vegetable coloring matters.  I have long been of opinion\nthat by the steeping of papers or textile fabrics, containing the salts\nnot only of iron, as recommended by Mr. Sella, but of tin, copper,\nbismuth, lead, etc., in solutions of cochineal, red cabbage, beetroot,\ngrass or the most ordinary foliage, etc., that the most useful results\nmight be obtained; though for _certain_ permanence I am not sure but that\nsome of the other processes which I have briefly run over with the\ncyanogen acid salts or metallic acid salts, as precipitators, may be more\nto be depended upon.  The processes with _precipitated oxides_, such as\nthe one with manganese and similar ones, with other metals which I have\ndescribed, I also consider as deserving of more attention than almost any\nprocesses which have been stated, on the score of probable permanence; but\nperhaps the best process for black, or generally useful neutral tint,\nwithout silver, that has yet been offered to the public, I believe to be\nthe process alluded to with the bichromate of potash and sulphate of\ncopper, toned by an iron salt.  *  *  *  This process, the cuprotype (as\nalso the uranotype and manganotype) is applicable perfectly to films of\n_albumen_ or gelatine on glass or porcelain, textile fabrics, parchment,\npaper, tiles and many other substances besides paper.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE DESIGNS.\n\n\n\n\n                      HOW TO MAKE A NEGATIVE DRAWING\n\n\nThe drawing paper for designs to be reproduced by the cyantotype and the\nother processes described in this book should be of a fine texture, free\nfrom opacities and very white; and, as the design must serve as a cliché\nit is a sine qua non that it be drawn with a very black ink and with\nwell-fed lines, especially those which are very fine.  To obtain a\ncomplete opacity, and, at the same time, to keep the ink quite fluid,\nwhich gives great facility to the designer, one adds some gamboge (or\nburnt sienna) to the India ink.  The ink of Bourgeois, which is compounded\nwith yellow and can be diluted as easily as India ink, is excellent, so is\nalso the American ink of Higgins.(3)\n\nAs much as possible it is desirable to replace the colored lines\nindicating the constructions, the axis, projections, etc., by differently\npunctuated lines made with India ink.  However, if the use of colors be\nobligatory on the original design, one should trace the red lines with\nvery thick vermilion or sienna, the yellow lines with gamboge, and the\nblue and green lines with a thick mixture of Prussian blue and chrome\nyellow in different proportions.\n\nOne must abstain from applying washes of any tints on the original. If\nnecessary they should be brushed over when the reproductions are made;\nmoreover they can be often replaced by cross-lines more or less open, and\nthe shadowing represented by thicker but not closer lines.\n\nTracing paper is recommended instead of linen, which latter, on account of\nits thickness and granulation, gives less satisfactory results in regard\nto the transparency of the ground and the continuity of the lines.\n\nTo reproduce a design on ordinary paper—not too thick—or an engraving,\netc., the paper is rendered transparent by rubbing over on the back of the\noriginal a solution of 3 parts in volume of castor oil in 10 parts of\nalcohol, by means of a small sponge.  When the paper is quite transparent,\nthe oil in excess is removed by pressure between sheets of blotting paper,\nand the paper dried before the fire or spontaneously.  The design so\ntreated is not in the least injured, for it assumes its primitive\ncondition by dissolving the oil from the paper by immersion into strong\nalcohol, which it is necessary to renew once or twice, then rinsing in\nalcoholized water if the drawing be in India ink, or simply in water in\nthe case of an engraving, and finally drying between sheets of blotting\npaper.\n\nInstead of an alcoholic solution of castor oil, vaseline can be employed.\nThe paper is more transparent.\n\nThe method by which are made negative drawings, that is, those which can\nbe used as negative clichés to reproduce the design in black lines on a\nwhite ground, is thus described by Mr. Cheysson, wlio originated it, in a\nmanual published by the Department of Public Works of France, from which\nwe have borrowed most of the above instructions for the drawing of designs\nsuitable for the photo-reproduction processes:(4)\n\n“One can avoid the necessity of making a negative from the original\ndrawing by transforming the drawing itself into a negative.”\n\n“To that effect it suffices to draw with lithographic ink, then to cover\nthe paper with aniline brown, and, after drying, to wash it with\nturpentine oil which dissolves the lithographic ink without altering the\naniline.  The lines appear then white on a brown ground impervious to\nlight (that is, non-actinic).  The design is thus transformed into a\nnegative, and can yield positive impressions with paper sensitized with\nsilver salts, the ferriprussiate or the bichromate of potash.  The\nlithographic ink should be very black and the lines well fed.”\n\n“When the drawing is finished it is placed on a board lined with sheets of\nblotting paper, then one spreads all over it the aniline brown with a\nbrush, and, lastly, after drying, the paper is carefully rubbed with a\nbung of cotton or a rag imbued with turpentine until the lines of the\ndesign are dissolved.”\n\nIn our practice we have often taken a negative cliché from drawings made\nin the ordinary manner, without the aid of the camera obscura (which would\nhave been too expensive for drawings of a certain size), by simply\nprinting a proof by contact on plain or albumenized silvered paper, and\nfixing, without toning, in a new solution of sodium thiosulphate, then\nwashing as usual.   The proofs thus obtained from designs drawn with an\nopaque ink, which allows a long insulation and, therefore, yields an\nintense reduction, are of a deep brick-red color, quite non-actinic, and\ngive very good positives by the Artigues process.\n\nN.B.—Paper in drying never assumes its original shape; it is, therefore,\nnecessary to make the figures on the reproductions from plans when they\nare not on the originals.\n\n\n\n\n                         CHOICE OF PAPER. SIZING.\n\n\nIn all the photographic processes by precipitation of metallic oxides the\nquality of the paper has a great influence on the results. When the paper\nis not well sized and not well calendered, the sensitizing solution is\nabsorbed, instead of simply impregnating the surface of the paper, and not\nonly the image is sunk in and its sharpness impaired, but good whites can\nnever be obtained, especially if the image should be toned, owing to the\nimpossibility of eliminating the metallic salts not acted on, that is, not\nreduced by the action of light which the fibers of the paper mechanically\nretain.\n\nThe “endless” rolls of paper, 54: inches wide—or “blue print paper,” as it\nis sometimes termed—of Blanchet fréres et Kléber, of Rives, better known\nas “Rives’ paper”, that of Johannot, of Annonay (France), and the\nSteinbach (Saxe) paper are recommended.\n\nFor small prints from negatives in half tone the positive paper, 18×22\ninches, of Rives or Saxe, should be preferred to the heavy kind.  It is\nadvisable to size it, so that the impressions be entirely formed on the\nsurface of the paper.  Moreover, an additional sizing is always\nadvantageous, whatever be the photographic process employed, to prevent\nthe imbibition of the sensitizing compound and to obtain more brilliant\nand vigorous images, for the iron, chromium, uranium and other metallic\nsoluble salts require the presence of an organic matter (alcohol, ether,\ngum arabic, glucose, caseine, etc.) to be reduced by the agency of light;\nand as a consequence, the greater, within certain limits, of course, the\namount of organic matters, and the more thoroughly they are mixed with the\nsalts, the more sensitive the preparation and the better the results.\n\nArrowroot is the best sizing for our purposes.  Gelatine may be employed,\nalbumen also, but the coating should be insolubized when applied on the\npaper and dry.\n\n_Sizing with Arrowroot._—In a porcelain dish diffuse 4 parts of powdered\narrowroot and one part of liquid glucose in 200 parts of distilled or rain\nwater and dissolve by heat over an alcohol lamp, stirring all the while.\nLet the solution boil for an instant, and when the paste is homogeneous\nlet it cool down and then remove the skin formed on its surface and strain\nit through a fine canvas.  Now provide with three small sponges free from\ngritty matters and cleaned in water, and nail by the four corners, one\nover the other, felt size uppermost, as many sheets of paper as you wish\nto size on a board somewhat smaller than the paper.  This done, with one\nof the sponges take a small quantity of the arrowroot and, brushing it\nlength-way and cross-way, spread the paste into an even layer, then, by\nrubbing very lightly with the second sponge, efface the striae and smooth\nthe coating as well as possible.  The third sponge serves to remove the\nexcess of paste when too much is at first spread on.  From six to seven\nsheets of paper, 18×22, can be sized with the quantity of arrowroot paste\nabove given.\n\nAnother, but not quite so effective a manner of sizing although sufficient\nfor the cyanotype, is the following, employed by Mr. Pizzighelli for the\npaper used in the platinotypic process:\n\nTen parts of arrowroot are powdered in a mortar with a little water and\nthen mixed by small quantities to 800 parts of boiling water. After a few\nminutes 200 parts of alcohol are added and the mixture filtered.  The\npaper is immersed for two or three minutes in the warm solution and hung\nup to dry.\n\n_Sizing, with Gelatine._—Dissolve at a temperature of about 140 deg. Fahr.\n(60 deg. C.) 10 parts of good gelatine in 800 parts of water, then add 200\nparts of alcohol and 3 parts of alum dissolved in a little water.  Filter\nand prepare the paper by immersion as above directed.  The gelatinized\npaper when dry should be prepared a second time and dried by hanging it up\nin the opposite direction in order to obtain an even coating.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CYANOTYPE OR BLUE PROCESS.\n\n\n_This process gives white impressions on a blue ground with diapositives\nor drawings on transparent or semi-transparent materials, and blue\nimpressions on a white ground from negatives._  It is commonly known under\nthe names of “blue print process,” “negative ferrotype process” and\n“ferro-prussiate process.”\n\nThe process is indeed exceedingly simple.  A sheet of paper, impregnated\nor sensitized, as it is termed, with a solution of ferric citrate and\nferricyanate is impressed under a cliché,(5) then immersed in pure water,\nwhereby the image is developed and at the same time fixed. It is on\naccount of the great advantages offered by its simplicity that this\nprocess is generally preferred by civil engineers and architects for the\nreproduction of their plans.\n\nThe sensitizing solution is prepared in mixing by equal volumes the two\nsolutions following:\n\nA.   Iron, ammonio       20 parts\n     citrate\n     Water               100 parts\nB.   Potassium           15 parts\n     ferricyanate (red\n     prussiate)\n     Water               100 parts\n\nAlthough the mixture keeps pretty well for a certain period in the dark,\nit is best to prepare only the quantity wanted for actual use.(6)\n\nThe paper is preferably sensitized in operating as follows:\n\nTake hold of the paper by the two opposite corners and fold it into a\nloop, lay it on the iron solution, the center of the sheet first placed in\ncontact with the liquid, and then gradually spread it by lowering the\ncorners with a little pressure.  No solution should run over on the back\nof the paper; it would be a cause of stain.  This done, and without\nallowing the liquid to penetrate _in_ the paper, immediately take hold of\nthe two corners near the body and withdraw the paper by dragging it over\non a glass rod for this purpose fixed on the edge of the tray.  Now pin up\nthe paper to dry, which should be done rapidly, and sensitize a second\ntime in proceeding in the same manner.  If this second sensitizing be\nfound objectionable, let float the paper for no more than ten seconds; of\ncourse this method of sensitizing is not applicable to prepare larger\nsheets of paper.  In this case the paper is pinned by the four corners on\na drawing board or any other support, lined with blotting paper and\nquickly brushed over with a sponge sparingly imbued with the sensitizing\nmixture, so as to wet the paper with a very small excess of liquid.\n\nThe rationale of this manner of sensitizing is to impregnate only the very\nsurface of the paper with the ferric salts, and thereby to obtain an\nintense blue with very good whites, which latter it would be impossible of\nobtaining should the sensitizing solution be allowed to reach in the\nfibers of the paper, for, in this condition, it is impossible, owing to\nthe exigencies of the process, to wash out thoroughly the iron salts to\nprevent the chemical changes which cause the whites to be tinted blue.  It\nis for this reason that better results are also obtained with well sized\npapers.\n\nThe sensitizing should be done by a very diffused daylight, and the\ndrying, of course, in a dark room.  When sensitized the paper is yellowish\ngreen.  It should be well dried for keeping, and rolled or wrapped in\norange or brown paper and preserved from the action of dampness and of the\nair.  It does not keep well, however, no more than two or three months,\nperhaps, in good condition; but the sooner it is employed the finer the\nproofs, the better the whites and more rapidly is the paper impressed.\n\nThere is in the market a paper which keeps for a long time.  It is\nprepared by adding a small quantity of gum arabic or of dextrine to the\nsensitizing solution.  Good for the reproduction of line work, it does not\ngive very satisfactory results for pictures in half tones.\n\nThe following compound gives a paper much more sensitive, but not keeping\nso long, than that prepared according to the formula previously given:\n\nTartaric acid               25 parts\nFerric chloride, solution   80 parts (in volume)\nat 45 deg. Baumé\nWater                       100 parts\n\nWhen the acid is dissolved, add gradually concentrated aqueous ammonia,\njust enough to neutralize the solution—170 volumes, about.  The chemical\nchange consists in the formation of ferric tartrate.  Let cool the\nsolution, then, after adding the following, keep it in the dark:\n\nPotassium ferricyanate   21½ parts\nWater                    100 parts\n\nAnother and very sensitive preparation is the following:\n\nA.    Iron perchloride,   40 parts\n      cryst\n      Oxalic acid         10 parts\n      Water               100 parts\nB.    Potassium           20 parts\n      ferricyanate\n      Water               100 parts\nMix\n\n_Printing._—The process we describe yields negative impressions, that is a\npositive image from a negative cliché, and a negative image from a\npositive cliché, exactly as the silver printing-out process ordinarily\nemployed in photography.  Consequently, for the production of non-reversed\nproofs from plans, etc., the original drawing should be placed _face\ndownwards_ on the glass plate of the printing frame, and, upon the back,\nthe sensitive paper is laid and pressed into perfect contact by means of a\npad, felt or thick cloth.\n\nThe printing frame is that used by photographers. The lid is divided,\naccording to the side, in two, three and even four sections, held by\nhinges and fastened for printing by as many cross-bars, in order that by\nopening one section, from time to time, the operator can follow the\nprogressive changes resulting from the action of light on the iron salts.\nTo print, the frame should be placed in the light in such a manner as the\nluminous rays fall perpendicularly upon the drawing or cliché.  The reason\nof this is obvious, since the sensitive paper is not in direct contact\nwith the design, but separated by the material upon which it is drawn.\n\nDuring the insolation—whose time depends necessarily from the more or less\ntransparency of the cliché, and, also, from the intensity of the\nlight(7)—the paper assumes first a violet tint, which gradually\nintensifies to a dark shade; then this tint fades, becomes brownish, then\npale lilac, while the parts under the lines—that is, the design—upon which\nthe light has, therefore, no action, are visible by keeping the original\nyellow-green tint of the prepared paper. It is when the lilac color is\nproduced that the exposure is sufficient.\n\nTo ascertain when the exposure is correct, a few black lines can be traced\non one of the edges of the margin of the design, and strips of the\nsensitive paper placed upon them to serve as _tests_ in operating, as it\nwill be explained in the description of the Cyanofer process.  When one of\nthem is taken out and show, by being washed in water, a clear white line\non a deep blue ground, the exposure is at an end.  One understands that\nthe blue color of the ground is more or less intense according to time of\ninsolation, for the chemical actions between the reduced and the\nnon-reduced iron salts is so much more complete as the salts acted on are\nmore or less deoxidized, that is, reduced to ferrous salts; and that to\nobtain the maximum of effect, which, therefore, depends on the allowable\ntime of exposure, the drawing ink should be opaque and non-actinic as far\nas possible, because when, on testing, the lines are tinted the exposure\nshould be discontinued. However, a slight coloration of the lines is not\nvery objectionable, for it disappears by a longer washing after the\ndevelopment.\n\nThe image is developed and fixed by washing in water two or three times\nrenewed.  The water must be free from calcareous salts; these salts\nconverting the iron into carbonates which impart an ochrey tinge to the\nproof.   Rain water—any water in which no precipitate is thrown down by\nthe addition of a few drops of a weak solution of silver nitrate—may be\nused with safety.\n\nDuring the development the ground takes a blue color which rapidly\nintensifies, while the iron compound, not acted on and imparting a yellow\ngreen tint to the design, is washed out from the white paper.  If the\nprint has not been sufficiently exposed the ground remains pale blue, more\nor less; the reason has been explained.  In this case the development\nshould be done quickly, as the blue is always discharged by washing.  On\nthe other hand, whenever the whites are tinted by excess of exposure, they\ncan be cleared partly or entirely by a prolonged immersion in water, but\nthe ground is also to some extent lightened.\n\nWhen the proof is well developed and fixed, that is, when the soluble iron\nsalts are eliminated, the blue color can be brightened by adding to the\nlast but one washing water a small quantity of citric acid, or of\npotassium bisulphate, or a little of a solution of hypochlorite of lime\n(bleaching powder).\n\nThe action of light in this, as well as in the other photographic\nprocesses with metallic salts described in this work, is one of\ndeoxidation, as shown by Herschel.  The chemical changes which produce the\nblue precipitate is quite complicated.  It is evident that both the ferric\ncitrate and the ferric cyanate are partly reduced to ferrous salts under\nthe luminous influence, and react in presence of water with the unreduced\npart of each of these compounds, the ferric citrate with the ferrous\ncyanate forming Prussian blue (ferric-ferrocyanate), and the ferric\ncyanate with the ferrous citrate giving rise to Turnbull’s blue (ferrous\nferricyanate).  The blue of the print is consequently a mixture in a\ncertain proportion of the two compounds; and as the color of Prussian blue\nis quite different from that of Turnbull’s, it follows that by varying in\na certain measure the percentage of the two ferric salts forming the\nsensitizing solution, the color of the blue may be varied thereby. Hence\nthe difference in the formulas given by different authors.(8)\n\nThe blue color of the image can be changed into black or dark green. But\nto that purpose the paper should be, although not exactly necessary, well\nsized as before directed, and sensitized with extra care to prevent the\nimbibition of the iron solution into the paper. After exposure the proof\nshould necessarily be thoroughly washed to eliminate the soluble iron\nsalts, then immersed for a moment in water acidified with nitric acid,\n1:100, and this done and without washing treated by a solution of aqueous\nammonia at 2 per 100 of water.  In this the blue color disappears, being\nchanged into a red brownish tint, which indicates that the Turnbull’s and\nPrussian blues are transformed, the former into ferroso-ferric hydrate,\nwith formation of ferrocyanate, and the latter into ferric hydrate.  It is\nby the action of tannin (gallotannic acid) on the ferric oxides thus\nformed that the black is produced, and by that of catechu-tannic acid\ncontained in the extract of catechu that one obtains a dark green, almost\nblack color.\n\nTo obtain the black tone it suffices to immerse the proof on its removal\nfrom the ammoniacal in a solution of tannin at 5 per 100 of water, and\nwhen toned, to wash it in a few changes of water.\n\nThe process to turn the blue color into a green was devised by Mr. Paul\nRoy.  It is as follows: Dissolve 7 parts of borax in 100 parts of water,\nand acidify the solution with sulphuric acid added drop by drop until the\nlitmus paper becomes red; then, in the same manner, neutralize with\naqueous ammonia not in excess, but just enough to show an alkaline\nreaction; this done dissolve 1 part of powdered catechu and filter.  In\nthis the proof is immersed after development until the desired effect is\nattained.  Wash, etc.\n\nTo clear the lines, or to make additions, or to write on the blue margin\nof the proof a solution of potassium oxalate is employed. It dissolves the\nblue without leaving scarcely any trace of it.  The solution can be\nprepared by mixing the two solutions whose formula is given below:(9)\n\nA.   Oxalic acid       10 parts\n     Water             100 parts\nB.   Caustic potassa   12½ parts\n     Water             100 parts\n\nThe blue prints are permanent.  When drying they darken a little from\noxidation; exposed to sunshine for some hours, they bleach considerably;\nbut in the shade the faded pictures progressively absorb oxygen from the\nair and assume their original intensity and color in a period so much the\nlonger as the insulation has been more prolonged; it may take weeks if the\npicture were much bleached.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CYANOFER. (PELLET’S PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives blue impressions on a white ground from positive\nclichés, and white impressions on a blue ground from negative clichés._\nIt is termed “positive ferrotype process.”\n\nThe cyanofer is an application of one of the numerous and useful\ninventions for which photography is indebted to A. Poitevin.  In 1863 he\ndiscovered that certain organic substances were rendered insoluble by\nferric chloride, and that they again became soluble; when under the\ninfluence of light the ferric chloride has been reduced to a ferrous salt.\nThis curious phenomenon is the base of the process now to be described.\nAs usual the process has been modified by compounding the sensitive\nsolution in various ways and by minor details in the manner operating.\nBut although these modifications have rendered the process easier to work\nwith, there is not a great difference in the results obtained.  We give\ntwo formulas.  Aside from the addition of gum arabic, which was suggested\nby Mr. Pellet, and which constitutes the capital improvement of the\nprocess, the formula is substantially that devised by Mr. Poitevin.\n\nPrepare three solutions as follows:\n\nA.   Gum arabic, best   50 parts\n     quality\n     Water              170 parts\nB.   Tartaric acid      12 parts\n     Water              80 parts\nC.   Ferric chloride    35 parts in volume\n     solution at 45\n     deg. Baumé\n\nMix gradually B to C, then C, by small quantities, in agitating briskly.\nIt is important to prepare the solution as directed, for by adding the\nferric chloride before tartaric acid, the gum arabic would be at once\ncoagulated.  When the ferric chloride is mixed, the solution at first\nthickens, but becomes sufficiently fluid for use in a certain period.  It\ndoes not keep, and should be employed the day it is made if possible.\n\nThe paper, which should be well sized and calendered, and which, when not\ngiving good results by too much absorbing the sensitive solution, must be\nstarched as before directed, is coated either by brushing or by floating.\nBy the first method a roll of paper five yards long can be prepared\nwithout great trouble, and give, perhaps, better results than if prepared\nby floating; but the latter method is by far the the most convenient: one\ndoes not generally prepare by brushing sheets of paper larger than about\n30×40 inches.\n\nFor brushing, the paper is pinned on a board, then, with a large badger\nbrush dipped in the sensitive solution, the latter is applied as evenly as\npossible; after which, by lightly passing the brush over, the striae are\nremoved, the coating well equalized, and the paper hung up to dry.  The\ncoating should not be very thin, and, above all, not too thick, for then\nit would require an unusually long exposure to allow the light acting\nthrough the whole thickness of the film, which is a sine qua non to obtain\na clear ground, i.e., not stained blue.\n\nTo prepare by floating, pour the solution in a shallow tray, which needs\nnot to be more than 20×34 inches, 30 inches being the width of the drawing\npaper usually employed; then roll the paper and place it on the solution.\nNow, taking hold of it by two corners, draw it out slowly: the paper will\nunroll by itself.  This operation can be done by diffused daylight, but,\nof course, the paper should be dried in a dark room.  It dries rapidly.\nEndless rolls are prepared by machinery.  To expose, the drawing is placed\nin the printing frame, face downwards, and the sensitive paper laid over\nit. The whole is then pressed into contact by interposing a cushion\nbetween the lid of the frame and the paper, and exposed so that the rays\nof light fall _perpendicularly_ upon it.\n\nThe cyanofer preparation is quite sensitive.  From half a minute to two\nminutes exposure, according to the intensity of the light and the\nthickness of the coating, is sufficient in sunshine to reproduce a drawing\nmade on the ordinary tracing paper.  In the shade, by a clear sky, the\nexposure is about five times longer, and varies from half an hour to an\nhour and more in cloudy weather, but then the design is seldom perfectly\nsharp.\n\nThe progresses of the impression is followed by opening one side of the\nprinting frame and examining the proof. The exposure is sufficient when\nthe paper is tinged brown on the parts corresponding to the ground of the\ndesign.  The image appears then negative, that is, yellowish on a tinged\nground.\n\nAnother and more safe method of ascertaining the correct time of exposure,\nwhich can be employed concurrently with the other, is to place a few\nstrips of the same sheet of sensitive paper between the margin of the\ndesign, upon which a few lines have been traced, and the paper, and,\nwithout opening the frame, to draw one of them, from time to time, and dip\nit in the developing solution.  If the whole strip be tinted blue, the\nproof is not sufficiently exposed; but if the lines soon appear with an\nintense coloration on the yellowish ground of the paper, and the latter do\nnot turn blue in a minute, at the most, the exposure is right.  By excess,\nthe lines are with difficulty developed or broken.\n\nFor developing, we provide with three wooden trays lined with lead or\ngutta-percha, or, more economically, coated with yellow wax.  The wax is\nmelted, then applied very hot, and, when it is solidified and quite cold,\nthe coating is equalized with a hot iron, whereby the cracks produced by\nthe contraction of the wax when cooling are filled up.\n\nOne of these trays should contain a layer, about three-quarters of an inch\nthick, of an almost saturated solution of potassium ferrocyanate (the\ndeveloper); the next be filled with water, and the third with water\nacidified by sulphuric acid in the proportion of three per cent. in\nvolumes.\n\nAll this being ready, the margin of the proof is turned upwards—so as to\nform a disk of which the outside is the impressed surface—in order that\nthe ferrocyanate solution does not find its way on the back of the proof,\nwhich would produce stains.  Now the proof is laid, the lower edge first,\non the developer, and gradually lowered upon it, when, taking immediately\nhold of it by the two corners nearest to the body, it is lifted out and\nheld upright to allow one following the development of the image; and,\npresently, if any air-bubbles are seen on the proof, they should at once\nbe touched up with a brush wetted with the ferrocyanate solution; the\nreason explains itself.\n\nThe image appears at once.  As soon as the fine lines are well defined,\nthe blue intense, and, especially, when the ground has a tendency to be\ntinged blue, the proof is placed in the tray filled with water and in this\nturned over two or three times, when it is immersed in the diluted\nsulphuric acid.  In this bath the print acquires a deep blue coloration,\nconsisting of Prussian blue, and the ground becomes tinted with a blue\nprecipitate without adherence, which is easily washed off by throwing the\nliquid on the proof with a wooden spatula, or, better, by rubbing with a\nrag tied to a stick.  When the ground is cleared, and after three or four\nminutes immersion to dissolve the iron salts acted on, the proof is rinsed\nin water several times renewed to free it from acid, and hung to dry.\n\nThere are two causes of failures in this process, viz., over and\nunder-exposure. In the former case the fine lines are broken or washed out\nin clearing the proof (which may also arise from the drawing made with an\nink not opaque enough); in the latter the ground is more or less stained.\n\nThe blue stains, the lines for corrections, etc., are erased with the the\npotassic oxalate (_blue salving,_ as it is termed) whose formula has been\ngiven.\n\nThe additions, corrections and writing are made with a _Prussian blue ink_\nprepared by mixing the two following solutions:\n\nA.   Ferric chloride,   4 parts\n     dry\n     Water              350 parts\nB.   Potassium          15 parts\n     ferrocyanate\n     Water              250 parts\n\nThe precipitate being collected on a filter and washed until the water\ncommences to be tinged blue, is dissolved to the proper consistency in\nabout 400 parts of water. This ink does not corrode steel pens.\n\nIt has been stated that the cyanofer process keeps for years if preserved\nfrom the combined action of dampness and the air.  The writer found in his\npractice that the ferric salts in presence of the organic matters (the\nsizes) acts as does potassium bichromate and renders, in a certain period,\nthe cyanofer film insoluble even after a prolonged insulation.  Paper\nfreshly prepared is always more sensitive and gives better whites and\ngenerally finer results.(10)\n\nThe prints can be toned black in operating as in the cyonotype, but the\nresults are seldom good.\n\nCaptain Pizzighelli’s formula is as follows: Prepare\n\nA.   Gum arabic        15 parts\n     Water             100 parts\nB.   Ammonia ferric    45 parts\n     citrate\n     Water             100 parts\nC.   Ferric chloride   45 parts\n     Water             100 parts\n\nFor sensitizing mix _in order_:\n\nSolution A   100 parts\nSolution B   40 parts\nSolution C   20 parts\n\nThe mixture very much thickens at first, but becomes sufficiently fluid\nfor use in a few hours.  It keeps well for two or three days. Leaving out\nB and replacing it by rain water, this makes also a good solution for the\ncyanotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK OR INK PROCESS. (FERRO-TANNATE PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives black positive impressions on white ground from\npositive clichés, and negative impressions from negative clichés._  It has\nbeen attributed to Mr. Colas, but in reality it was invented by Mr.\nPoitevin, who describes it as follows in his communication of May, 1860,\nto the Société Francaise de Photographie:\n\n“I make a solution containing—”\n\nIron perchloride, cryst   10 parts\nTartaric acid             3 parts\nWater                     100 parts\n\n“I apply the paper on this mixture and let it dry spontaneously in the\ndark, and at the moment of using it I completely desiccate it at a gentle\nheat. Thus prepared the paper is of a deep yellow color.  Light decolors\nit rapidly, and ten or twelve minutes’ exposure through a positive cliché\nsuffices to well impress it, that is, to reduce in the whites the iron\nperchloride to the state of protochloride.”\n\n“To print, one is guided by the decoloration of the paper, and even for\nmore facility I add to the solution of iron perchloride and tartaric acid\na small quantity of a solution of potassium sulphocyanide for the purpose\nof obtaining a red tint, which is more visible and disappears also under\nthe influence of light in proportion to the decomposition of the\nperchloride.  One obtains then after exposure a red design on the white\nground of the paper.  This red color is not permanent.  It even disappears\nby keeping the proof in the dark.”\n\n“To develop and then to fix the design thus obtained I wash rapidly the\npaper in ordinary water, or better, in water holding chalk in suspension.\nThe red coloration disappears, a part of the iron perchloride is washed\nout, and in the parts which have not been acted on by light the\nperchloride is transformed into sesquioxide.  I replace then the water by\nsolution of gallic acid or of tannin and the image progressively appears\nin ink-black.  When I judge the image to be sufficiently intense I wash\nthe proof in rain water, in preference to ordinary water, which might\ncause the gallic acid and tannin to turn brown. I sponge between sheets of\nblotting paper and let the proof dry spontaneously.”\n\n“If in place of gallic acid I use a diluted solution of potassium\nferricyanide (red prussiate of potash), Prussian blue is formed in the\nparts acted on by light.  The preparation is even sensitive enough to\npermit one to obtain an impression in the camera obscura in developing by\nthe ferricyanide.”\n\n“As to the proofs in gallate (or tannate) of iron, they can be transformed\ninto Prussian blue in a solution of potassium ferrocyanide (yellow\nprussiate of potash) slightly acidified by sulphuric acid.”\n\nThe paper most suitable for this process is that which has been previously\nwell sized with starch, as explained in a special paragraph of this\npamphlet. Paper prepared with a film of coagulated albumen gives also good\nresults.  It may be prepared by brushing as well as by floating, but in\neither case the paper should be wetted on the surface only and dried\nrapidly at a temperature of about 115 deg. Fahr. (46 deg. C.) and kept in\na dry place.  It does not keep for more than from ten to fifteen days,\nowing to the hygroscopicity of the iron compound.  Mr. Colas, who prepares\nthe paper for the Parisian market, I think, states that he avoids its\ndeterioration by keeping it wrapped in blotting paper, between two sheets\nof India rubber, to exclude air and dampness.  Silvered albumen and plain\npaper, well desiccated, could be kept in that way for a certain period,\nespecially if the blotting paper is impregnated with sodium bicarbonate\nand well dried.\n\nMr. A. Fisch advises to discard the preliminary washing and to develop\njust on the removal of the proofs from the printing frame.  In operating\nin this manner the development is best made by floating, taking care that\nthe solution does not run off the back of the proof.\n\nThe developer may consist of a dilute solution of nutgalls or of\n\nTannin or gallic acid   4 parts\nOxalic acid             0.15 parts\nWater                   1,000 parts\n\nAfter developing the proof should be washed rapidly—under a jet of water,\nif possible—for were the iron salt and the reagent not soon removed, or\nany remain in the paper, the ground would be tinted violet.  And whatever\nbe the care taken, it very seldom occurs that the whites are pure when the\nproof is dry.  This for half-tone pictures has not a great importance, but\nfor the reproductions of plans it is sometimes objectionable.  In fact it\nmust be acknowledged that none of the processes now at our disposal—if we\nexcept the so-called Artigues process described further on—gives an\nentirely satisfactory result.  A simple and expeditious process, yielding\nintense black impressions on a white ground, is yet to be found for the\nreproduction of plans, maps, etc., without resorting to a negative cliché\nor drawing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CUPROTYPE. (BURNETT’S PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives positive impressions from negative clichés._\n\nUranic nitrate   10 parts\nCupric nitrate   2 parts\nWater            100 parts\n\nFloat for a minute strong, well-sized paper on this solution and let it\ndry spontaneously in the dark.  Expose until the image is visible, then\ndevelop by floating on a solution of potassium ferricyanide at 5 per 100\nof water—the image appears at once with a rich brown color.  When\ndeveloped, wash it in several changes of water until the unaltered salts\nare eliminated.  The proof is then fixed, and, if too intense, can be\nreduced in water slightly acidified with hydrochloric acid.  A fine black\nimage is obtained by toning in a solution of platinic chloride at 1 per\n100 of water.\n\nThe chemical actions giving rise to the formation of the metallic\nferrocyanide, of which the image consists, are quite complicated.  Under\nthe luminous agency the uranic nitrate is first reduced, then the uranous\noxide acts on the cupric nitrate, forming cupric oxide, which is finally\nreduced to the metallic state.  This metal now converts the ferricyanate\nin the ferro compound, which, by another action, forms both cupric and\nuranic ferrocyanate.\n\nThe following uranium process gives black impressions:\n\nIn a saturated solution of tartaric acid dissolve freshly precipitated\nferric oxide, and keep the solution—ferric tartrate—in the dark.  To\nprepare the sensitizing solution, dissolve 20 parts of uranic nitrate and\nfrom 1 to 3 parts of tartaric acid in 100 parts of water, and add a small\nquantity of ferric tartrate, the proportion varying with the tint desired:\nan excess gives a blue black. With this solution brush the paper over,\nand, when dry, expose under the negative cliché, then develop with a\nsolution of potassium ferricyanate at 4 per 100 of water. To fix, it\nsuffices to wash in water, renewed three or four times.\n\nAs pointed out by Mr. B. J. Burnett (see Introduction), many photographic\nprocesses can be devised by basing them upon the various chemical changes,\nof which uranous oxide, reduced by light from the uranic nitrate or\nsulphate, is susceptible by means of metallic or organic reagents.\n\nIn the Appendix some of the most important processes, with or without\nsilver salts as reagents, will be described.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANILINE PROCESS.\n\n\nThe aniline process was published in 1865, by Mr. Willis, the inventor of\nthe platinotype.(11) It is based on the oxidation of aniline by chromic\nacid, thus: A sheet of paper brushed with a solution of potassium\nbichromate and sulphuric acid, dried, and after insolation under a cliché\nexposed to the fumes of aniline which, in reacting with the chromic\ncompound not reduced by light, forms a blue-black image.  _The process\ngives, consequently, a positive impression from a positive cliché._\n\nThere are various methods of operating; we will briefly describe them.\n\n        SENSITISING SOLUTION.\n1.      Potassium            6 parts\n        bichromate\n        Sulphuric acid       6 parts\n        Magnesium chloride   10 parts\n        Water                150 parts\n\nWillis recommended 10 parts of solid phosphoric acid instead of sulphuric\nacid; the latter forms a preparation about twice more rapidly reduced.\n\n2.   Potassium            10 parts\n     bichromate\n     Manganous sulphate   4 parts\n     Potassium            20 parts\n     bisulphate\n     Water                300 parts\n3.   Ammonium             5 parts\n     bichromate\n     Ammonium chloride    5 parts\n     Cupric sulphate      1 part\n     Sulphuric acid       8 parts\n     Water                150 parts\n\nGood well-sized paper should be employed. Rives is too tender and absorbs\ntoo much.  Steinbach is better.  For small sizes, whatever be the paper\nselected, it is well to size it with starch and, if possible, to calender\nit on a hot steel plate, or, in lieu, to iron it.  This is not, however, a\nsine qua non. The paper is sensitized by brushing or by floating.  To\nsensitize by floating, it should be left but for a few seconds on the\nsolution and removed by dragging it on a glass rod in order to remove the\nsuperfluous liquid.  Only the surface of the paper should be impregnated,\notherwise the whites would be more or less tinted and the image imbedded\nnot as sharp.\n\nSensitized, the paper must be dried as rapidly as possible. It does not\nkeep, and should be employed the day it is prepared or the day after,\nkeeping it well wrapped in paper.\n\nAs said above, it is exposed under a positive cliché, plans, designs,\netc., drawn on tracing paper or linen.  The more transparent the material,\nthe more rapid the chemical changes.  During the insolation—and it is very\nshort—the chromic compound is reduced, the parts corresponding to the\nground, that is, the transparent parts of the cliché, are discolored,\nwhile those under the design remain unaltered; the image being, therefore,\nfaintly visible, and being formed of the chromic mixture, it is developed\nby the fumes of aniline in a blue black tone.  Therefore, if the paper be\nnot sufficiently exposed, the ground is colored like the image, although\nnot as deeply, since the dye formed is proportionate to the more or less\nquantity of unreduced compound, and if exposed too long the image is\nimperfectly developed or not at all by excess.\n\nThe discoloration of the ground, which turns to a greenish hue, easily\nindicates when the exposure is sufficient.  But, to ascertain it, the\nbeginner should use _tests_ as in the cyanofer process.  Mr. Endemann\nregulates the time of exposure by partly covering a strip of the sensitive\npaper with a piece of the tracing material upon which the design is made,\nand exposing the whole until the covered part of the paper assumes the\nsame shade as the part directly exposed to light.\n\nTo develop the print is placed in the bottom of a tray, which is then\ncovered with a lid upon which is pinned blotting paper well imbued with an\naniline and benzine mixture, or the reverse; that is, exposing the print\nfastened to the lid and placing the aniline on the bottom of the tray.\nThe tray should be hermetically closed; that is a condition to obtain a\nfine and equal coloration.  For this purpose the lid should be well lined\nwith sheets of blotting paper and a weight placed over it during the\noperation.  Large prints are necessarily developed in a fumigating box\nmade ad hoc.  The aniline solution consists of\n\nAniline (commercial for   8 parts\nred)\nBenzine, rectified        100 parts\n\nIn place of benzine, ether U.S.P., sp. grav. 0.837, may be used.\n\nWhen the proof is not over-exposed the development commences in a few\nminutes.  The image first takes a dirty black olive color which turns blue\nin water, then the tone darkens to a dark-brownish tint.  The time of\nexposure to the aniline fumes depends on the time of insolation; if short,\nthe ground is soon tinted, and consequently the development should then be\nstopped; if over-exposed, the development proceeds slowly.  The darkest\ntone is obtained by a rather full exposure which admits a long fumigation.\nSometimes the image takes a green color; it suffices then to wash the\nproof in water rendered alkaline by a few drops of aqueous ammonia to\nobtain the normal color.\n\nTo somewhat improve the tone of the image and, if objectionable, to remove\nthe chromic oxide which tinges the ground greenish, the proof should be\nimmersed in a dilute solution of sulphuric acid 1:100, then washed twice,\nand finally passed in ammoniacal water 1:100.\n\nMr. Hermann Endemann has published, in 1866, the following process in the\n_Journal of the American Chemical Society_, pp. 189 et seq.:\n\nThe paper, which must be well sized with glue, 1:50, is sensitized with\nthe following solution and exposed when dry, but still slightly damp:\n\nA.   Potassium         1 ounce or 480\n     bicarbonate       parts\n     Salt              1 ounce or 480\n                       parts\n     Sodium vanadate   2/3 grain or 0.66\n                       part\n     Water             20 ounces or 9,600\n                       parts\nB.   Sulphuric acid    2 ounces or 960\n                       parts\n     Water             10 ounces or 4,800\n                       parts\n\nWhen cold mix to A.\n\n“From the composition of the solution,” says Mr. Endemann, “it is evident\nthat it must be strongly acid; but when this solution is exposed to light,\nin the presence of the organic substances of the paper, the acidity of the\nsolution disappears, we obtain potassium and sodium sulphates, basic\nchromium sulphate, salt and vanadic acid.  While, therefore, the unchanged\nparts of the paper remain acid, the changed parts acquire a neutral\nreaction, and while the first will readily assimilate bases, the second\nwill not.  Exposed in an atmosphere laden with water and aniline, the\naniline will be absorbed in those parts where the solution remains acid\nand in proportion to the remaining acidity.”\n\nTo develop the image the paper is spread over the opening of a frame\ntightly placed on a pan, in the bottom of which is heated a solution of\naniline in water, 1:50, until the image appears brown, and for further\ndevelopment in a box laden with steam water, which, according to Mr.\nEndemann, requires two hours to obtain a deep black coloration.  To remove\nthe chromium compound the picture is immersed in a solution of aqueous\nammonia, 1:6, then washed and dried.\n\nA few years ago the aniline process was improved by developing the image\nwith the aniline-benzine mixture vaporized by steam in a box made\nspecially for that purpose, whereby a reproduction can be obtained in less\nthan ten minutes.\n\nIn the photographic department of Messrs Poulson & Eger’s Hecia\nArchitectural and Ornamental Iron Works, which is directed by Charles\nBilordeaux, this process is worked in the following manner:\n\nThe developing is made of sheet iron with a door sliding up and down, it\nbeing balanced by a counterpoise, and provided with a chimney.  In the box\nis a gutter, extending the whole length of the bottom, covered with muslin\nand connected to a steam pipe; there is also a coil similarly connected.\nAfter the insolation, which requires about one minute in sunshine, the\nprint is suspended in the box, the muslin brushed over with the solution\nof aniline, and live steam allowed to pass through the gutter for only two\nminutes, whereby the aniline being vaporized acts on the chromic salt and\ndevelops the image; then the steam is allowed in the coil, and, in from\nthree to four minutes, the paper is dry and the picture finished. The\nimage stands on a slightly greenish ground, which is not objectionable for\nthe purpose the reproductions are made.\n\nThe sensitizing solution is similar to that published by Mr. Endemann,\nviz.:\n\nPotassium bichromate   460 grams\nSodium chloride        460 grams\nAmmonium vanadate      0.75 gram\nSulphuric acid         1 liter\nWater                  13 liters\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRIMULINE OR DIAZOTYPE PROCESS.\n\n\nPrimuline, discovered in 1887 by Mr. A. G. Green, an English chemist, is a\ndye of a primrose color, possessing a great affinity for cotton fibers, to\nwhich it is readily fixed by simply immersing the material for a few\nmoments in a hot solution of the dye.  If the material so dyed be placed\nin an acidified solution of nitrous oxide, the primuline is diazotized,\nforming a derivative compound of a deeper color, which fades in the light,\nand which in presence of amines and phenols gives rise to a variety of\ndyes whose color depends on the reagent employed, while, when acted on by\nlight, the resulting compound is entirely deprived of this property.  In\nother words, the diazotized primuline acts as a mordant only when not\naltered by the luminous action.\n\nThe chemical change light effects in the diazotized primuline is not well\nknown.  It is pretty certain, however, that nitrogen is set free, for if\ngelatine imbued with primuline be immersed in water after insulation,\nnitrogen is set free and can be collected as usual in a tub filled with\nwater and inverted on the substance.\n\nBy itself diazotized primuline is slowly influenced by light, but quickly\nacted on in presence of organic substances.  It is more sensitive when\napplied on cotton or paper than on wool, silk, linen, and such organic\ncompounds as gelatine, albumen, caseine, starch, etc.  Its sensitiveness\nis about one-tenth less with gelatine than with cotton.\n\nThe sensitiveness of diazotized primuline to light, when united to organic\nsubstances and the different colors which can be obtained with the\nunaltered compound, have given rise to an interesting printing method, the\ninvention of Messrs. A. G. Green, C. F. Cross, and E. J. Bevan, which\nyields _positive impressions from positive clichés_.  The manipulations of\nthe process are simple:\n\nIn a certain quantity of rain water, kept at nearly the boiling\ntemperature by an alcohol lamp placed under the vessel, dissolve per cent.\n2 parts of commercial primuline, and in this immerse, by means of a glass\nrod, some pieces of calico—free from dressing—turning them over several\ntimes during the immersion.  When the fibers are well imbued, which\nrequires from four to five minutes, remove the calico with the glass rod\nand rinse it thoroughly in water.  This done, wring out the superfluous\nliquid as much as possible, and, finally, immerse each piece separately in\na solution of\n\nSodium nitrite,      7 parts\ncommercial\nHydrochloric acid,   16  parts\ncommercial\nWater                100 parts\n\nAfter turning the pieces of calico two or three times over, they are\nrinsed to eliminate the acid, then drained and placed between sheets of\nblotting paper to dry.  All this, except the impregnation with primuline,\nshould be done in the dark room.\n\nAs said above, primuline is transformed by nitrous oxide into a diazotized\ncompound, and consequently the material is now susceptible of being acted\non by light.  It does not keep, and should be exposed, etc., soon after\nits preparation.\n\nPaper is impregnated with primuline either by floating or brushing.  The\nbest results are obtained with paper previously sized with arrowroot or\ngelatine in order to keep the image entirely on the surface of the paper.\n\nLinen, silk and wool are treated as calico.\n\nThe clichés should be positive to obtain positive expressions and somewhat\nmore opaque than those employed in the processes before described, else\nvigor and intensity could not be obtained.  Here we must state that the\nprimuline process seems to be better adapted for the reproductions of\ndrawings, such as made for the black process, and of opaque photo-clichés\nin lines, or white and black, than for printing in half tone.\n\nWhen the material to print upon is thick and wholly impregnated with\ndiazotized primuline, it is advisable, since the insulation could not be\nprolonged to effect the change through, to expose the back of the material\nfor a certain but short period in order to _clear_ it.  This is especially\nadvantageous when the cliché is not of good intensity.\n\nDuring the exposure, which varies from 30 seconds to 10 minutes and more\nby a dull light, the progresses of the luminous action is seen by the\nbleaching of the material which assumes a dingy coloration.  But in order\nto ascertain when the decomposition is complete on the ground of the\nimage, it is well to use _tests_ as in the cyanofer process, dipping one\nof them in the developer from time to time.\n\nThe developers are compounded as follows:\n\n         FOR RED.\nBeta-naphthol     4 parts\nCaustic potassa   6 parts\nWater             500 parts\n\nRub the alkali and the naphthol with a little water in a mortar and add\nthe remainder of the water.\n\n    FOR ORANGE.\nResorcin   3 parts\nWater      500 parts\n\nWhen dissolved add\n\nCaustic potassa   5 parts\n\n          FOR YELLOW.\nCarbolic acid, cryst   5 parts\nWater                  500 parts\n\n          FOR PURPLE.\nNaphthylamine           6 parts\nHydrochloric acid, in   6 parts\nvolume\n\nMix in a mortar, then add\n\nWater   500 parts\n\n             FOR BLACK.\nEikonogen, white crystals   6 parts\nWater                       500 parts\n\nPulverize the eikonogen, add the water and, at the same time, the material\non its removal from the printing frame, and keep in motion until the\ndevelopment is effected.\n\n      FOR BROWN.\nPyrogallol   5 parts\nWater        500 parts\n\nAfter the development, which requires but a few moments, it suffices to\nwash the material to fix the image by eliminating the soluble compounds.\nHowever, for purple the material should be passed in a dilute solution of\ntartaric acid and not washed afterwards; it should remain acid.\n\nWhen it is desirable to obtain an impression in several colors, the\nvarious developers are thickened with starch, then locally applied with a\nbrush on the image, which is always visible after exposure.\n\nFor printing on wood, glass and porcelain, see further on.\n\n\n\n\n\n            PRINTING ON WOOD, CANVAS, OPAL, AND TRANSPARENCIES\n\n\n_Printing on Wood._—To print on a wood block a design to be engraved on\nthe same presents certain difficulties.  In the first place, the\nsensitizing solution must not be absorbed by the wood, but remain wholly\non its surface; then the photo film, although thick enough to produce an\nimage sufficiently intense to be distinctly visible in all its details,\nshould not scale or clip away under the graver, and not interfere in any\nway with the work of the artist; the least touch of the graver must reach\nthe wood and make its impression.  Lastly, the design should be permanent.\nThese difficulties will be avoided by adhering to the instructions given\nin the lines following.\n\nThe solution to render impervious the surface of the wood consists of\n\nCommon gelatine   5 parts\nGum arabic        3 parts\nCastile soap      3 parts\nWater             100 parts\n\nDissolve by heat on a water bath.\n\nTo apply it, the wood is rubbed with fine sandpaper, then heated over a\nspirit lamp to about 86 deg. Fahr. (30 deg. C.) and upon it is poured in\nexcess the liquefied and quite warm solution, which must be allowed to\npenetrate in the pores of the wood by letting it gelatinize, when it is\nwiped off clean.  Nothing must remain on the surface of the wood. This\ndone, and while still damp, the preparation is rendered insoluble by\npouring over a solution of alum at 5 per 100 of water.  The object of this\npreliminary operation is to render the wood impervious, and therefore to\nprevent the sensitizing solution to penetrate its texture.  The wood is\nthen heated again and its surface whitened with a little silver white or\nsulphate of barium, diffused in a small quantity of the following warm\nsolution:\n\nGelatine   1 parts\nAlum       0.1 part\nWater      100 parts\n\nWhile wet, this is smoothed with a jeweler’s brush, taking care to leave\non the wood, a very thin layer of the mixture, only sufficient to obtain a\nwhite surface which, by contrasting with color of the wood assists the\nengraver in his work.  The wood should now be allowed to dry thoroughly,\nwhen it is coated with a tepid solution of\n\nIsinglass   3 parts\nWater       100 parts\n\nand dried.\n\nNow the sensitizing process differs according as whether the cliché is\npositive or negative.  In the former case the preparation is sensitized\nwith the solution employed in the black process, proceeding afterwards as\nusual; in the latter, that is, when the cliché is negative, the best\nprocess is the cuprotype.(12)\n\nFor printing, special frames are employed to permit one to examine the\nprogress of the impression from time to time without the possibility of\neither the wood block or the cliché moving.  These frames open in two.\nThe upper frame is provided with screws on the four sides to hold firmly\nthe block when it is placed into contact with the cliché by means of the\nscrews fixed on the cross bars.  As to the cliché, if it is made on a\nglass plate, it is secured on the thick glass plate of the lower frame by\ntwo wooden bars against it pushed by screws.\n\nWhen the block is ready for printing, the prepared side is usually\nconcave.   It is straightened by slightly wetting the back and resting it\non one end, prepared side against the wall.\n\n_Printing on Canvas.—_The canvas should be first brushed with a solution\nof aqueous ammonia in alcohol, 1:3, to remove greasiness until the thread\njust commences to show, then, when rinsed and dry, rubbed with fine sand\nto give a tooth, dusted, washed with a sponge and then coated with the\nfollowing solution, proceeding afterwards as in the cuprotype process:\n\nIsinglass        8 parts\nUranic nitrate   5 parts\nCopper nitrate   2 parts\nWater            200 parts\n\n_Printing on Opal, Celluloid, etc._, is quite simple; it suffices to coat\nthe material with the following gelatine solution, and, when the film is\ndry, to proceed in operating by any one of the processes before described.\n\nThe sensitizing compound may be incorporated to the gelatine solution, but\nwe prefer not to do it and to sensitize the plates as they are wanted for\nuse.\n\nA.   Gelatine   4 parts\n     Water      70 parts in volume\n\nDissolve and mix little by little in order:\n\nB.   Chrome alum   0.25 parts\n     Water, hot    20 parts\nC.   Alcohol       10 parts\n\nWhen coated place the plates on a level stand until the gelatine is set,\nand let them dry on a rack.\n\n_Transparencies._—Prepare the plate as directed above with\n\nA.   Gelatine      6 parts\n     Water         70 parts\nB.   Chrome alum   0.3 part\n     Water, hot    20 parts\nC.   Alcohol       10 parts\n\nSensitize with the uranic-copper solution employed in the cuprotype.  By\nthis process transparencies of a rich brown, not actinic, color are\nobtained.  Consequently they can be used to reproduce negatives by the\nsame process.  For lantern slides they may be toned black by platinic\nchloride.\n\nTo strip off the picture, apply, first, on the glass plate a substratum of\nIndia rubber, 2 to 100 of benzole, coat with plain collodion, immerse the\nplate in water as soon as the film is set, and when greasiness has\ndisappeared pour on the gelatine solution and proceed.\n\nFor tranferring on any material, a sheet of paper is immersed in a\nsolution of India rubber cement in 20 parts of benzole, dried, coated with\nthe gelatine solution, sensitized, etc., by operating in the ordinary\nmanner.  After development, the proof, being dry, is brushed over with\nalumed gelatine moderately warm, dried, immersed in tepid water until the\ngelatine is softened and tacky, when it is placed on the material and\nsqueezed into contact.  This done, the transfer should be allowed to dry\nthoroughly.  Now, by imbuing the proof with benzole to dissolve the India\nrubber, the paper is easily stripped off, leaving behind the picture\nadhering to the material.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACING PROCESS ON METAL.\n\n\nWe call the attention of metal engravers to this process.  It is well\nknown that wood engravers have their original designs photographed on the\nblock in order to save considerable time by not making the drawing\nthemselves; moreover the cost is nominal, so to say, and the copy more\ntrue and perfect than it can be done by hand.  Why should not the copper\nengraver and the aquafortist avail themselves of the same advantages?  A\nfew do it secretly, no doubt, but the generality not knowing the process,\nor, if so, not having tried it, think it is not possible or that it may\nspoil their plates.  This is an error.  It can be done and very easily by\nadhering to the following instructions:\n\nDissolve 2 parts of ammonium bichromate in 100 parts of water, and in this\nlet soak for an hour or so 10 parts of Coignet’s best gelatine, then\ndissolve on a water bath, filter through flannel, and the solution is\nready for use.\n\nBefore being coated, the plate should necessarily be cleaned free from\noxidation and greasy matters.  This is done by immersing the plate for a\nfew moments in a warm solution of common potash, then rinsing and rubbing\nit with chalk moistened with a little water, when after rinsing again and\ndraining the plate should be immediately prepared.\n\nTo spread the gelatine solution in an even and thin layer, a tournette is\nemployed.  The most simple consists of a round wooden stick of which the\nupper part is carved in the form of a cup with an edge, or rim, about one\nquarter of an inch broad.  On this rim is melted some gutta-percha, upon\nwhich the plate is pressed into contact and adhers quite firmly when the\ngutta-percha is solidified.  The stick is perforated at the lower end and\nrevolves on an iron pivot fixed at the bottom of the support, being held\nin the opening on the platform of the same, as shown in the diagram on the\nfollowing page.\n\nThe plate being fastened to the tournette, the warm gelatine solution is\nflowed over it and spread to the edges by means of a glass rod or a piece\nof cardboard, avoiding air bubbles.  This done the tournette is set into\nmotion, and when the film is equalized, which is done in a moment, the\nplate is detached, placed on a leveled stand and slowly dried with the\nspirit lamp.\n\n                              [A Tournette]\n\nBy a good light the exposure on the shade does not exceed twenty minutes\nwith a pretty intense transparency, and should be regulated with a\nphotometer.  When the insulation is sufficient, the image is slightly\nvisible, and should be so.  The plate is then bordered with banking wax\nand bitten-in with a solution of ferric chloride at 45 deg. Baumé, or—\n\nFerric chloride, crystal   20 parts\nHydrochloric acid          1 part\nWater                      100 parts\n\nThe parts of the gelatine film the most acted on are impermeable, so to\nsay, and consequently do not allow the etching fluid to penetrate to the\ncopper; while those the least impressed are permeated according as to\ntheir degree of insolation, Therefore, when the ferric chloride solution\nis poured upon the film and carefelly brushed over with a soft brush, in a\nfew moments the image progressively appears, the deep blacks first, then\nthe half tints, and lastly the most delicate details, the whole requiring\nbut a few minutes. It is now that the etching action should be stopped by\nwashing under the tap.  However, should by excess of exposure, or any\nother cause, the details not appear within five or six minutes, the ferric\nchloride should nevertheless be washed off, for then it may find its way\nunder the film and the plate would be spoiled.  After washing the gelatine\nis dissolved in a solution of potash, etc., when the image would be found\nslightly engraved.\n\nShould the image be in half-tints, it would be advisable to apply a grain\nof rosin on the gelatine film just before etching.  To engrave on steel\nthe operations are the same, but on its removal from the printing frame\nthe plate should be soaked with water renewed several times until the\nbichromate is washed off.  The film is then dried spontaneously and\nafterwards flowed for about two minutes with the Solution A, then, this\nbeing thrown away, with the Solution B, which is allowed to act for a\nsimilar period.\n\nA.   Nitric acid, pure   120 parts\n     Silver nitrate      6 parts\n     Alcohol, 95 deg     50 parts\n     Water               75 parts\nB.

Pale\nblue is a very actinic color which is not reproduced in photography,\nexcept by the ortho-chromatic process, or if it does, the impression being\nvery weak, is not objectionable.  When the image has not been sufficiently\nor not at all bleached, the blue is dissolved by an alcoholized solution\nof the blue solving.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE URANOTYPE.\n\n\nThis process, devised by J. Wothly, in 1864, did not receive from the\nphotographers the attention it merits, as it is always the case when a\nprocess is patented, and can be replaced by another equally practical\nwhich is not.  It gives pictures of a very good tone, which are quite\npermanent; we have some made in 1866, which are suffered no change\nwhatever, they seem to have been printed from yesterday.\n\nThe first process given by Wothly does not appear to be complete.  It has\nbeen well described by H. Cooper and a gentleman who signs by the initial\nletter X.\n\nThe process published in 1865 by Wothly is as follows: A sheet of paper is\nsized by brushing with a paste made of 24 parts of arrowroot in 500 parts\nof water, to which are added a few drops of a solution of citric or\ntartaric acid, then coated with a collodion consisting of 100 cubic\ncentimeters of plain collodion, a few drops of oil of turpentine and 30\ncubic centimeters of the following sensitizing solution:\n\nNitrate of uranium     30 to 90 parts\nChloride of platinum   2 parts\nAlcohol                180 parts\n\nThe time of exposure is about that required for paper prepared with silver\nchloride.  The image is bluish-black but weak.  After washing the print is\nimmersed in a solution containing 0.5 parts of chloride of gold for 2,000\nparts of distilled water, and then fixed in a bath of sulphocyanate of\npotassium, which tones the image blue-black.\n\nIt may happen that the proof is slightly tinted red. This arises from a\nsmall quantity of lime in the paper which forms uranate of calcium.\n\nTo prevent the proofs turning yellow, it should be washed in an\nexceedingly weak solution of acetic acid.\n\nIf, after exposure, the print is immersed, without it being washed, in the\ngold bath, the image becomes rose-red, but the whites remain pure. The\neffect is peculiar.\n\n\n\n\n                       H. COOPER’S PROCESS (1865).\n\n\n     PREPARATION OF THE PAPER\nSt. Vincent arrowroot   200 grains\nBoiling water           10 ounces\n\nCrush the arrowroot to fine powder, then rub it to a paste with a little\nwater, and let an assistant pour a few drams of boiling water while you\nkeep stirring all the time; finally, let him add the rest of the boiling\nwater, the operator still continuing the stirring.  The paste is allowed\nto cool, and will be thicker when cold than when hot.  Remove the upper\nportion entirely when quite cold, otherwise, if any left, it will give\nrise to streaks.  The author insists upon the necessity of all these\ncares.  Two sheets of paper are now placed side by side on a flat board,\nthen the surface of the first is covered with the paste by means of a\nsponge, proceeding, before you leave it, all over the sheet in a\nhorizontal direction; the second sheet is covered in a like manner.  By\nthe time the second sheet is pasted, the first one will be partially dry.\nThe sponge is now drawn over each sheet, in succession, in a perpendicular\ndirection in order to efface the streaks from the first sponging.  If the\npaste drags in a slimy manner, it is too strong, and a fresh arrowroot\nmust be prepared, because dilution only ends in failure.  Why dry, the\npaper is rolled under moderate pressure, and when it lies smoothly the\nmaximum pressure may be applied.\n\n   PLAIN COLLODION.\nAlcohol      12 ounces\nEther        4 ounces\nPyroxyline   80 grains\n\n       SENSITIVE COLLODION.\nPlain collodion            1 ounce\nNitrate of uranium, pure   30 grains\nNitrate or silver          5 grains\n\nAdd the uranium first, and as soon as it has dissolved all that it can,\nadd a grain or two of soda, and when settled pour off the supernatant\ncollodion and add the silver.(14) To coat the paper with collodion, use a\nboard with a handle beneath, such as is used by plasterers.  On this place\na sheet of paper, the edges being turned up about the sixteenth of an\ninch; this enables the whole of the sheet to be covered without spilling\nthe collodion or allowing it to run on the back of the paper.\n\nThere is a marked difference in the appearance of the prints when they\nleave the pressure frame. Some samples of collodion cause the picture to\nprint of a beautiful green, others of a rich brown, and some of a yellow\nor orange tint.  The last take the longest of all to tone, and difficultly\nassume the tint of well toned silver prints,(15) those printing to green\nor brown tone very rapidly.\n\nAfter printing the pictures are placed in diluted sulphuric acid, 1 to 30\nof water, until the high lights are perfectly clear and white; this takes\nfrom ten to fifteen minutes.  After washing well under a stream of water,\nthey are placed in the toning and fixing bath.\n\n         TONING AND FIXING BATH.\nSulphocyanide of ammonium   1 ounce\nWater                       12 ounces\nChloride of gold            1 to 3 grains\n\nAfter removing from this bath, the prints are immersed for a few moments\nin water, and then rapidly washed.\n\n    FORMULA FOR PREPARING THE PYROXYLINE\nNitric acid, sp. gr. 1.30   12 fluid ounces\nSulphuric acid, sp. gr.     36 fluid ounces\n1.845\nWater                       8 fluid ounces\nTemperature                 130 degrees Fahr.\nTime of immersion           15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n              X’S PROCESS (1865).

It has been described theoretically and practically\nby Pizzighelli and Kübl in a paper for which the Vienna Photographic\nSociety has awarded the Voightlander prize.(17) The following is an\nabridgment of this important process, as described by the authors:\n\nThe paper, calendered or not,(18) is sized with gelatine or arrowroot.\nThe color of the proof with the latter size is brownish black, and bluish\nblack with the former.\n\nTo prepare the gelatine solution 10 parts of gelatine are soaked in 800\nparts of water and then dissolved at a temperature of 60 deg.

After boiling for a few minutes 200 parts of\nalcohol are added and the mixture filtered.\n\nThese solutions are employed warm.  The paper is immersed for two or three\nminutes and hung up to dry in a heated room, then immersed a second time\nand dried by hanging it up in the opposite direction, in order to obtain\nan even coating.\n\nThe potassic platinic chloride is an article of commerce.  It should be\nsoluble without residue in 6 parts of water and without acid reaction.  In\nthis proportion it constitutes the normal stock solution employed in the\nvarious formulas.\n\nThe standard ferric oxalate solution is also found in commerce. Treated by\npotassium ferricyanate it should not be colored blue, nor become turpid\nwhen diluted with one-tenth part of water and boiled.  The former reaction\nindicates that it contains no ferrous salt, and the latter no basic\noxalate.\n\nThe authors give the following instructions for preparing the ferric\noxalate solution, to which they attach much importance:\n\nFive hundred parts of ferric chloride are dissolved in 5,000 parts of\nwater and heated to boiling, when a solution of soda is added until the\nliquid becomes alkaline.(19) About 250 parts of caustic soda are generally\nemployed for this purpose.  The precipitate—ferric oxide—is now washed in\nwarm water until the last washing water is quite neutral to test paper,\nthen drained and mixed with 200 parts of pure crystallized oxalic acid.\nThe mixture is then allowed to stand in the dark for several days at a\ntemperature not exceeding 30 deg. C. (86 deg. Fahr.)  At first the\nsolution from green turns to a yellow green, and finally becomes almost\nbrown.  At this moment the excess of ferric oxide is filtered out and the\nliquor submitted to a quantitative analysis, the result of which leads to\nascertain the quantity of ferric oxalate in 100 parts of the solution and\nthe excess of oxalic acid.  The solution should then be diluted with\ndistilled water, such as it contains 20 parts of ferric oxalate per 100\nparts of water, and oxalic acid must be added in the proportion of from 6\nto 8 per 100 of the ferric oxalate, taking into account the quantity of\nacid the solution already contains.  The solution should be kept in the\ndark.  It is altered by light.(20)\n\n       IRON CHLORATE SOLUTION\nFerric oxalate solution   100  parts\nPotassium chlorate        0.4 parts\n\nThis solution is employed to obtain more contrasts.\n\n  PREPARATION OF THE SENSITIZING SOLUTION\nPlatinum solution         12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution   11 parts\nDistilled water           2 parts\n\nThis solution gives very soft tones with intense black.  To obtain more\nbrilliancy we use the following proportions:\n\nPlatinum solution           12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution     9 parts\nChlorate of iron solution   3 parts\nDistilled water             2 parts\n\nTo obtain results comparable to those which the silver printing out\nprocess gives, the following mixture is employed:\n\nPlatinum solution           12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution     8 parts\nChlorate of iron solution   4 parts\nDistilled water             8 parts\n\nFor very weak negatives, reproductions of drawings, etc., we use—\n\nPlatinum solution   12 parts\nChlorate of iron    11 parts\nDistilled water     2 parts(21)\n\nTo obtain proofs not completely black, as, for example, reproductions of\nlead drawings, the solution may be diluted with half or the whole volume\nof distilled water.  But if the solution be applied on little absorbent\nsurfaces or on paper strongly sized it is not advisable to dilute it.\n\n_Preparation, of the Paper.—_The paper should be kept slightly moist in\norder that it does not too completely absorb the sensitizing solution.\nTherefore, when the atmosphere is very dry, it is well to keep the paper\nin a damp place, in the cellar for example.  Before sensitizing, which\nshould be done by a very diffused light, a quantity of the solution\nproportionate to the surface to be sensitized (about 15 c.c., for a whole\nsheet of Rives’ or Saxe paper) must be measured, and spread with a large\nbrush(22) on the paper fixed with drawing pins on a board covered with a\nsheet of blotting paper.  When well impregnated, the paper is hung up to\ndry in the dark room, and as soon as the apparent dampness of the surface\nhas disappeared, it should be dried immediately at a temperature of 30—40\ndeg. C. (86—101 deg. Fahr).  If the paper be dried too rapidly the\nsensitive compound remains on its surface, and in developing the image\ndoes not come out well.  If, on the other hand, the drying is too slow,\nthe solution penetrates too much in the paper and the image is wanting of\nvigor and does not appear very sharp.  One cannot depart from this rule\nthat the desiccation from the moment the solution has been applied until\nthe paper is dry should last no more than from twelve to fifteen minutes.\n\nThe sensitized paper is hygroscopic and must be preserved in a calcium\nbox.  _It is a conditio sine qua non that the paper must be quite dry\nbefore, during, and after printing, to obtain good results._  Dampness is\nthe greatest enemy in this process.\n\nFor printing a pad of India rubber should be placed over the platinum\npaper to prevent it from attracting the atmospheric moisture, and in damp\nweather it is even advisable to cover it with several sheets of blotting\npaper previously heated before the fire.\n\nThe platinum paper is at least three times more sensitive than the silver\npaper used in the printing-out process, under the reductive action of\nlight the yellow color of the prepared paper turns brown and then becomes\nof a lighter color, nearly orange, so that the darker parts of the image\noften appears more luminous than the dark half tints.  No rule can be\ngiven to regulate the insolation, but after a few trials it is easy to\njudge when it is right by observing the progress of the reduction and the\ncolor of the image. The orange color indicates the complete reduction of\nthe ferric oxalate.  When the details in the lights are _faintly_ visible,\nthe exposure is generally right.\n\nThe developer consists of an almost saturated solution of potassium\noxalate _acidified by oxalic acid,_ and for use heated to 80—85 deg. 0.\n(176—184 deg. Fahr.),(23) in an agate glazed iron tray placed upon a water\nbath at the above temperature. By simply drawing the proof over it, the\nimage is at once developed.(24)\n\nWhen the proof is thought to be over-exposed, the oxalate solution can be\nemployed at a lower temperature.  If, on the contrary, it is\nunder-exposed, the solution may be heated even to the boiling point.\n\nThe developer can be used over and over again.  _It should always have an\nacid reaction._\n\nAccording to Mr. Borlinetto a sepia tone is obtained by using the\nfollowing cold developer:\n\nSaturated solution of   120   parts\npotassium oxalate\nSaturated solution of   13   parts\ncopper chloride\nOxalic acid             1.5 part\n\nAfter developing the proofs are _immediately_ immersed for fixing in a\nsolution of hydrochloric acid, 1 to 80 of water, renewed so long as the\npaper is tinged yellow (about three times), leaving the proofs ten minutes\nin each solution.  Lastly, they are washed to remove the acid.\n\nThe platinotype has been still improved by Captain Pizzighelli, who\ndevised the following methods of operating by which the impressions are\nobtained by the continuous action of light, that is, without development,\nthus rendering the platinotype just as simple as the ordinary printing-out\nsilver process.\n\nIn these new processes to the sensitizing solution is added the alkaline\noxalate, which effects the reduction of the platinous salt during the\nexposure to light.  Consequently the prepared paper is insolated until the\nimage appears as it should be, or—which is exceedingly useful in cloudy\nweather—until it is entirely visible but still deficient in delicate half\ntones, for in the dark the action proceeds and the image developing itself\nwill be found finished in a period which may extend to a few hours.  But\nit can be, however, developed in a few seconds by immersion in a cold or\nslightly warm solution of sodium carbonate, 1:25 of water. The image is\nfixed as directed in the foregoing process.\n\nThe paper, prepared exactly as in the former process and kept in the\ncalcium box until wanted for use, should not be employed quite dry, but\nallowed to absorb a little moisture by hanging it in the dark room.\nHence, the India rubber and other protecting pads can be dispensed with.\nThey are even objectionable, for dampness is absolutely necessary to\npromote the chemical changes by which the image is developed.\n\n    A. AMMONIO-FERRIC OXALATE SOLUTION\nFerric oxalate solution    100 parts\nNeutral ammonium oxalate   18 to 20 parts\n\n    B. SODIO-FERRIC OXALATE SOLUTION\nFerric oxalate solution   100 parts\nNeutral sodium oxalate    15 to 18 parts\n\nTo prepare these two solutions the ammonium or sodium oxalate is dissolved\nby small quantities at a time, and when the emerald color due to the\nformation of the double oxalate commences to darken, the saturation being\nthen complete, no more of either salt should be added.  The solution is\nnow well shaken with 3 parts of glycerine, allowed to settle and filtered.\n\nAny one of the double oxalates can be used.  The ammonium tends to produce\nsofter pictures and bluish tones.  To obtain more contrasts a little\npotassium chlorate may be added.\n\n   C. IRON CHLORATE SOLUTION\nSolution B           100 parts\nPotassium chlorate   0.4 part\n\n       D. MERCURIC SOLUTION.\nMercuric chloride         20 parts\nsolution at 5:100\nSodium oxalate solution   40 parts\nat 3:100\nGlycerine                 2 parts\n\n      SENSITIZING SOLUTIONS.\n         FOR BLACK TONES.\nPlatinite solution, 1:6   5 parts\nSolution B                6 parts\nSolution C                2 parts\n\n        FOR SEPIA TONES.\nPlatinite solution, 1:6   5 parts\nSolution C                4 parts\nSolution D                4 parts\n\nIntermediate tones are obtained by diminishing the dose of C and replacing\nit by an equal volume of B.  For this process the paper should be sized\nwith\n\nArrowroot                 2 parts\nSodium oxalate at 3:100   100 parts\n\nTo dispense with this preliminary sizing Captain Pizzighelli adds gum\narabic to the platinite solution, whereby the sizing and sensitizing are\ndone in one operation.\n\nThe gum arabic solutions are prepared as follows:\n\nE.   Gum arabic in       40 parts\n     powder\n     Sodium ferric       40 parts\n     oxalate solution,\n     B\n     Sodium oxalate      100 parts\n     solution at 3:100\n     Glycerine           3 parts\n\nPlace the glycerine and the gum arabic in a mortar, then, stirring with\nthe pestle, dissolve by adding, little by little, the mixture, heated to\n40—45 deg. C. (104—113 deg. Fahr.), of the solution of sodium ferric\noxalate and sodium oxalate.  Let stand for about two hours and grind again\nto dissolve entirely the gum arabic. Filter through muslin.\n\nF.

The solutions do not keep.  The paper prepared by\neither one of these two processes can be exposed as in the _old_ process,\nand the image developed bythe hot oxalate solution.\n\nThe preparation of wood, canvas, etc., for the platinotype printing need\nnot to be described; it suggests itself.\n\n\n\n\n                           CAUSES OF FAILURES.\n\n\n_The images are veiled._\n\nThis defect may result from various causes, viz.:\n\n 1st. The stock ferric oxalate solution is impaired by a partial reduction\n      of the ferric salt into ferrous oxalate.  The solution should be\n      preserved in an orange colored vial, and kept in the closet of the\n      dark room.  It should be tested from time to time for the ferrous\n      salt with a solution of potassium ferricyanate.  If it does not\n      contain any ferrous oxalate it can be used by adding to it a little\n      of the iron chlorate solution.\n  2d. The paper has been exposed to light during the sensitizing or the\n      subsequent operations.  One should bear in mind that the platinum\n      paper is twice more sensitive than silvered paper.\n  3d. The sensitized paper has been dried at a temperature above 40 deg.\n      C. (104. deg. Fahr.)\n 4th. Over-exposure.\n\n_The proofs are not sharp._\n\n 1st. The sensitive paper has absorbed moisture.\n  2d. It is too old.  The paper cannot be kept good for over six weeks,\n      unless special care be taken.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bory, the sensitive paper altered by keeping is restored\nto its original good quality by simply brushing it over with a solution of\n0.05 parts of potassium chloride or the same quantity of potassium\nchlorate in 100 parts of distilled water, or a mixture of these two\nsolutions, or one of iron chlorate.\n\nBy treating the insolated paper with these solutions, the image is\ndestroyed, and the paper can be used again.  One operates as for\nsensitizing, taking care to desiccate the paper, as it has been directed.\n\n_The proofs are brilliant during the development, but become dull in\ndrying._\n\nThe paper not well sized. It has been dried too slowly.\n\nRemember that it should be quite desiccated within fifteen minutes.\n\n_The paper is more or less yellow._\n\n 1st. The paper tinted with ultramarine.\n  2d. The sensitizing solution or the developer are not sufficiently acid.\n  3d. The washing (fixing) in the solution of hydrochloric acid was not\n      sufficient to eliminate the iron salts from the paper.\n\n_The proofs harsh, devoid of half tones._\n\n 1st. The sensitizing solution contains too much iron chlorate.\n  2d. Exposure too short.\n\n_The paper is stained._\n\nThe brush not kept clean while sensitizing.\n\n_Black spots._\n\nThey are generally due to metallic dust in the paste of the paper, or from\nparticles of undissolved salt in the platinite solution.\n\nNB: No good results can be expected unless the paper be kept absolutely\ndry before, during and after exposure, when using the former (original)\nprocess.\n\nImpaired sensitiveness of the paper, want of vigor, tinged whites,\nmuddiness, indicate dampness.\n\n\n\n\nARTIGUES’ PROCESS\n\n\nThe Artigues process, so called, is, without any doubt, the best to be\nemployed for the reproduction of plans and drawings in lines.  It is\nsimple, expeditious, and yields black impressions on a very pure white\nground which are absolutely permanent.  And this is of the utmost\nimportance when the copies are to be used for military purpose, or kept in\narchives, such as those of the Patent Office, for example.  Should it not\nrequire the use of negative clichés, it would certainly supersede any of\nthe processes previously described; moreover, as it will be seen, it can\nbe employed for many other purposes than that of obtaining duplicates from\noriginal drawings.  The objection is not even very great indeed, for the\ndesign can be, without great trouble, transformed into a negative by the\naniline method described in the beginning of this work.\n\nThe Artigues process is an adaptation for the purposes in question of the\ncarbon process invented by Poitevin.  We shall describe it in extenso.\n\nThe paper can be prepared with any one of the following solutions:\n\n 1st. Dissolve 2½ parts of ammonium bichromate and 5 parts of best gum\n      arabic in 15 parts of water and neutralize with a few drops of\n      concentrated aqueous ammonia; then add 100 parts in volume of whites\n      of egg and a certain quantity of thick India ink, and, this done,\n      beat the whole to a thick froth.  In ten or twelve hours the albumen\n      will be deposited and ready for use.\n\n      The quantity of India ink added to the albumen should be such as the\n      paper be black when coated, but, however, sufficiently transparent\n      for one to see the shadow of objects placed on the back of it, and\n      the coating should not be thick.  This is important in order to\n      allow the light acting through the whole thickness of the\n      preparation when the paper is insolated under the cliché, for, if\n      the film be too opaque or too thick (by addition of too much gum\n      arabic), it would be only impressed on its surface, and the image\n      dissolved during the development.  The cause of this failure must be\n      explained.  Under the action of light the bichromate employed to\n      sensitize the albumen is reduced into chromic oxide which render\n      insoluble this organic substance—or any other, such as caseine,\n      gelatine, gum arabic, etc.; therefore whenever the film is not acted\n      on in its whole thickness, the subjacent part being still soluble,\n      is necessary washed off and with it the superficial impressed part,\n      that is, the image.\n\n  2d. Take 10 parts of lamp black and work it up in a mortar to the\n      consistency of a thin paste by gradually pouring a little of a\n      solution of from 6 to 8 parts of gum arabic and 1 part of liquid\n      glucose in 100 parts of water, adding afterwards the remainder, into\n      which 2½ parts of ammonium bichromate have been dissolved, and\n      filter through flannel.  With this, coat the paper by brushing so as\n      to form a thin and uniform film, and pin it up to dry in the dark.\n\nThese solutions keep well for a certain period.  We have kept the albumen,\nwhich we prefer to use, for two months in good condition; but the\nsensitive paper does not for more than three or four days in taking the\nusual care.  It is more practical—and this is recommended—to leave out the\nbichromate from the preparations, and to coat the paper, in quantity,\nbeforehand, and for use to sensitize it with a solution of potassium\nbichromate at 3½ per cent. of water applied on the verso with a Buckle\nbrush.(25)\n\nThe bichromate solution should be allowed to imbue the paper for about one\nminute, and having brushed it once more, the paper is pinned up to dry in\nthe dark room.  It can also be sensitized from the back by floating, if\nthis manner is found more convenient.\n\nWhen dry the paper is impressed under a negative cliché of good intensity\nuntil the design, well defined in all its details, is visible on the back\nof the paper, which requires an insolation of about two minutes in clear\nsunshine, and from eight to ten times longer in the shade.  In cloudy\nweather the exposure to light is necessarily very long.\n\nAs explained before, the luminous action, by reducing the chromic salt in\npresence of certain organic substances, causes the latter to become\ninsoluble; consequently if, on its removal from the printing frame, the\nproof be soaked in cold water, for, say, ten minutes, and, placing it on a\nglass plate or a smooth board, gently rubbed with a brush or a soft rag,\nthe parts of the albumen or gum arabic preparation not acted on will\ndissolve, leaving behind the black image standing out on the white ground\nof the paper.  This done, and when the unreduced bichromate is washed out\nin two changes of water, the operation is at an end.\n\nAs to the theory of this and similar processes, the insolubilization of\nthe bichromate organic substance acted on by light was formerly attributed\nto the oxidation of the substance by the oxygen evolved during the\nreduction of the chromic salt into chromic oxide; but from the fact that\noxidation generally tends to destroy organic matters, or to increase their\nsolubility, it is more probable that it results from the formation of a\npeculiar compound of the substance with chromic oxide (J. W. Swan);\nmoreover, gelatine imbued with an alkaline bichromate, then immersed first\nin a solution of ferrous sulphate and afterwards in hot water, is\ninsolubilized with formation of chromium trioxide, Cr2O7K2+SO4Fe =\nSO4K2+C2O4Fe+C2O3 (Monckhoven).  A similar but inverse action occurs, as\nshown by Poitevin, when gelatine rendered insoluble by ferric chloride\nbecomes soluble by the transformation, under the influence of light, of\nthe ferric salt into one at the minimum.\n\nThe writer has improved the above process by simplifying the modus\noperandi as follows:\n\nInstead of compounding the preparation with gum arabic and the coloring\nmatter, the albumen is simply clarified by beating the whites of eggs to a\nfroth, etc., and the paper is coated by floating for one minute, then hung\nup to dry in a place free from dust.\n\nIf the reader has any objection for albumenizing his own paper, he can use\nthe albumen paper found in the market for the printing-out silver process\ngenerally employed by photographers.\n\nThe paper is sensitized from the back with the potassium bichromate bath\nby floating or by brushing.  When dry, it is exposed as usual, but for a\nshorter period than when the preparation contains the India ink or other\ncoloring matters which impede the action of light.\n\nThe progress of the impression is followed by viewing, from time to time,\nthe albumenized side of the paper.  When the design is visible, well\ndefined and brownish, the proof, being removed from the printing frame, is\nrubbed with very finely powdered, or, better, levigated graphite, and,\nthis done, immersed in cold water for from fifteen to twenty minutes, when\nby gently rubbing it under a jet of water with a soft rag, or with a\nsponge imbued with water, the albumen is washed off from the parts not\nacted on, leaving the design on a perfectly white ground.\n\nIf instead of graphite, or any dry color insoluble in water, lithographic\nink, much thinned with turpentine oil, be applied on the print in a light\ncoating which permits one to see the design under it, and if, then, the\nprint be soaked in water and afterwards developed as just directed, an\nimage in greasy ink is obtained.  And, furthermore, by replacing the\nprinting by transfer ink, one readily obtains a transfer ready for the\nstone or a zinc plate to be etched in the ordinary manner.\n\nAs usual there are two causes of failures in these processes, viz., under\nand over-exposures.  In the former case the image is partly washed off; in\nthe latter the ground cannot be cleared.  The reasons are obvious.\n\nMr. de Saint Florent gives the following processes:(26) A sheet of\nalbumenized or gelatinized paper is sensitized from the verso on a\nsolution of potassium bichromate, dried in the dark and exposed under a\npositive cliché.  After insolation, the proof is washed in water, to which\nare added few drops of ammonia, then inked all over with an ink consisting\nof 100 parts of liquid India ink, 7 parts of sulphuric acid and 3 parts of\ncaustic potassa, and dried in a horizontal position.  When quite dry, the\nproof is placed in water, and after an immersion of about ten minutes,\nrubbed with a soft brush: the image little by little appears, and if the\ntime of exposure be right, it is soon entirely cleared, and, then, if not\nenough vigorous, it may be inked again.  The gloss of the image is removed\nby means of a solution of caustic potassa at 10 per 100, and the proof\nfinally washed with care.\n\nIf in lieu of albumen paper, one employs paper prepared with a  thin\ncoating of gelatine, and dissolves the not acted on gelatine in warm\nwater, a very fine positive image is obtained by means of acidified inks\nwhich will fix themselves on the bare paper.\n\nPositive impressions from positive clichés can also be obtained in\noperating in the following manner: On its removal from the printing frame\nthe proof is washed, sponged between sheets of blotting paper, then\ncovered with not acidified India ink mixed with potassium bichromate, and,\nwhen dry, exposed from the verso to the action of light.  This done the\nimage is cleared with a somewhat hard brush.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CARBON PROCESS.\n\n\nThe carbon tissue is seldom prepared by photographers. However, for the\nsake of completeness, we shall give the formula of the mixtures most\ngenerally employed, and describe the manner of coating the paper on a\nsmall scale.\n\n_Preparation of the Tissue.—_The gelatine generally recommended to\ncompound the mixture is the Nelson’s autotype gelatine.  Coignet’s gold\nlabel gelatine, mixed with a more soluble product, such as Cox’s gelatine,\nfor example, gives also excellent results.\n\nGelatine    110 parts\nSugar       25 parts\nSoap, dry   12 parts\nWater       350 parts\n\nThe coloring substances consist of:\n\n FOR ENGRAVING BLACK.\nLamp-black     20 parts\nCrimson lake   2 parts\nIndigo         1 part\n\n   FOR WARM BLACK.\nLamp-black     3 parts\nCrimson lake   3 parts\nBurnt amber    2 parts\nIndigo         1 part\n\n         FOR SEPIA\nLamp-black         2 parts\nSepia of Cologne   18 parts\n\n FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC RED BROWN.\nIndia ink        3 parts\nCrimson lake     4 parts\nVan Dyck brown   4 parts\n\nFor blue, Turnbull’s blue is employed; for yellow, light chrome yellow;\nfor red, carmine dissolved in aqueous ammonia, evaporating, then adding\nwater, etc. (See further on.)\n\nTo prepare the mixture, dissolve the sugar and soap in the cold water, add\nthe gelatine, let it soak for an hour, then dissolve it in a water bath\nand mix by small quantity the colors finely ground together and wetted to\nthe consistency of a paste.  After filtering through flannel the mixture\nis ready for use.\n\nFor coating, the method devised by Mr. Alf. Harman has been found\nexcellent in the hands of the writer, not only for the purpose in\nquestion, but also for coating paper with gelatinous or viscous (gum\narabic) preparations.\n\n“Take two tin dishes, such as used for the development of the carbon\nprints; arrange one on your bench tilted to an angle; the lower angle is\nintended to receive the warm water for keeping the gelatine mixture to a\nproper temperature.  Into this angle of the tray arrange another tray\nsomewhat smaller, and keep it from touching the bottom of the outer one by\nthe insertion of any small article that will suggest itself. Into the\ninner tray the gelatine mixture is to be poured.”\n\n“The actual making of the tissue can now be proceeded with, and is so\nsimple and certain as not to be believed until put to the test.  Purchase\na roll of paper-hanger’s lining paper of good quality, cut it into widths\nof about one and a half inch less than the width of your inner tray, and\nin length of, say, thirty inches.  For the success of the operation it is\nnecessary that the paper be rolled up the narrow way.  Now having just\nsufficient water at a temperature of 100 deg. Fahr. (38 deg. C.) into the\nouter tray, pour the gelatine mixture into the inner one, and take one of\nthe lengths of rolled paper, and, holding it by both ends, gently lower it\non the surface of the gelatine; then at once slowly raise the end of the\npaper, which will unroll itself and become beautifully coated in far less\ntime than it takes to describe.  Twenty sheets may be coated in a quarter\nof an hour, and be equal in all respects to that made by the most\nexpensive machine.”\n\nIn the description of this method of coating, Mr. Harman does not explain\nhow the gelatine should be allowed to set before hanging up the paper to\ndry, which is, however, obviously important.  It is as follows: Place on\nthe tray a smooth board a little larger than the sheet of paper, leaving a\nsmall space at the end furthest from the body, and slowly, without a stop,\ndraw off the paper, prepared side uppermost, on the board upon which it\nshould remain until the gelatine is set.  If the paper curls up, wet the\nback a little with a sponge before coating.\n\nThe following coating method, due to Mr. Chardon, is excellent for sheets\nof paper of the ordinary photographic size, 18×22 inches.\n\nOn a glass plate placed on a leveled stand, is laid a sheet of paper\npreviously wetted, which is then flattened into contact with an India\nrubber squeegee, taking care to remove the air bubbles interposed. The\nquantity of gelatine necessary to coat the paper is regulated by means of\na glass rod held by an iron lath, which serves to handle it; at each end\nof the rod is inserted a piece of an India rubber tube whose thickness\nregulates that of the gelatine layer. The mixture is poured from a small\nteapot, at the opening of which has been adapted a bent glass tube about\nthree-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, between the rod and the lath, so\nthat by a simultaneous motion, one can equalize the gelatine as it is\npoured on. When the gelatine is set the paper is hung up to dry.  In\ndrying, the gelatine contracts, and, necessarily, causes a deformation of\nthe tissue, which curls up at the edges and loses its planimetry.  To\nprevent this, while the gelatine is almost dry, the tissue is placed under\npressure until quite desiccated.  Dumoulin advises to apply on the film,\nwhile still soft and tacky, a wooden frame, which, by adhering to it.\nkeeps the tissue perfectly plane as it dries.\n\n                      [Chardon’s method of coating]\n\n_Sensitizing.—_The tissue is sensitized in a bath of potassium bichromate.\nThe degree of concentration of the bath, which varies from 2 to 5 per\ncent. of water, is important.  The tissue sensitized in a weak bath is\nless rapidly acted on by light and yields more contrasts than when imbued\nin a concentrated one.  The former should consequently be employed for\nprinting weak negatives, and the latter for those which are intense.  A\nbath compounded with 30 parts of potassium bichromate, 1,000 parts of\nwater and 2 parts of aqueous ammonia, is used for printing negatives of\nthe ordinary intensity, the tissue being, then practically of the same\nsensitiveness, a silvered paper insolated to obtain a print not\nover-exposed.  For intense negatives the ammonia should be discarded and\nreplaced by the same quantity of chromic acid.\n\nThe time of immersion has also a certain influence on the results.  The\nless the tissue is allowed to absorb the solution the less sensitive it\nis, but also the more the tendency of the half tints to be washed off\nduring the development.  Generally the tissue should remain immersed until\nit lies flat and the edges just commence to curl up, unless white and\nblack impressions are desired, but even then it is preferable to operate\nas said above, using a bath at 2 per cent.\n\nFor use the bichromate bath should be cooled down to 15 deg. C. (59 deg.\nFahr.), and much lower in summer, say 10 deg. C. (50 deg. Fahr.), and kept\nat about this temperature by placing pieces of ice around the tray.  At 20\ndeg. C. (68 deg. Fahr.) the prints are more or less granulated; above this\nthe gelatine is softened and the reticulation greater; at 25 deg. C. (75\ndeg. Fahr.) it may dissolve.\n\nThe addition of alcohol to the bichromate bath—sometimes recommended to\nharden the film and allow it to stand a higher temperature, and to hasten\nthe desiccation of the tissue—is objectionable, for the spirits tend to\nreduce the bichromate, which is transformed into the green salt, and,\ntherefore, a partial or complete insolubilization of the gelatine is the\nresult.\n\nAqueous ammonia added to the sensitizing solution has for its object to\npermit one to keep the sensitive tissue for a somewhat longer period, but\nit renders it less sensitive.  If enough be added to turn the solution\nyellow weak prints are obtained.\n\nThe bichromate bath should be renewed often. It does not keep owing to the\npresence of gelatine and other organic matters which it dissolves and\nwhich cause the reduction of the chromic salt even in the dark.  The\ntissue prepared in such a bath is not very sensitive and the image\ndevelops with difficulty, and even cannot be developed at all.\n\nAs said above, the tissue is well sensitized when its edges commence to\ncurl up.  It is then removed from the bath by drawing it on a glass rod\nfixed at the end of the tray, and placed, prepared side down, on a\nslightly waxed glass plate, rubbing it with an India rubber squeegee to\nremove the superflous liquid, when it is hung up to dry.\n\nWhile wet the bichromated tissue is insensitive; the sensitizing can\ntherefore be made by daylight, but the drying should of course be done in\nthe dark room, that is in a room lighted by a candle or the sunlight\nfiltered through a deep orange window glass.\n\n_Caution.—_The soluble bichromates are very poisonous.  By absorption they\nproduce skin diseases not without danger and very difficult to cure. Hence\nwhen handling the wet tissue the fingers should be protected by India\nrubber tips, and any yellow, stains on the hands should be rubbed with a\ndilute solution of aqueous ammonia, and the hands well rinsed in water.\n\n_Drying.—_When the tissue dries rapidly it adheres well on the support\nupon which it is applied for developing and yields brilliant images which\nare easily cleared.  On the other hand, were it allowed to dry slowly the\nadherence would not be so complete, the image dull and developing with\ndifficulty.  They may even refuse to develop at all from the\ninsolubilization of the gelatine.\n\nIn winter and in the cool days of spring and autumn, the gelatine dries\nquick enough in the air, but when the weather is warm and damp, the\ngelatine, drying very slowly, may be so softened as to run off, or to\nproduce an entirely objectionable reticulation, or the defects above\nmentioned.  This may be avoided by drying it pinned up in a box, or a\ncloset, over quick-lime.\n\nWhen dry, the tissue is generally wrinkled, brittle, breaks easily in\nhandling and cannot be laid flat on the cliché; but by holding it over a\nbasin of boiling water, the steam in a few moments rendering it\nsufficiently pliable to lay it flat between glass plates, where it should\nbe kept under pressure until wanted for use.\n\nThe writer always dries the tissue in the following manner, which he\ndevised about sixteen years ago.(27) And not only the least trace of\nreticulation is avoided, but the tissue, drying quite flat, lies in\nperfect contact with the negative, which is quite important to obtain\nproofs exactly sharp all over.\n\nA clean glass plate is rubbed with talc, or, which the writer prefers,\nflowed with a solution of(28)\nYellow wax, pure   1 part\nBenzine, pure      100 parts\n\nthen strongly heated, allowed to cool and rubbed clean (apparently) with a\npiece of flannel.  After once more repeating this operation the plate is\ncoated with the following plain collodion:(29)\n\nEther, conc.      250 parts, in volume\nAlcohol, 95 deg   250 parts, in volume\nPyroxyline        3 parts\n\nWhen the film is set, the plate is immersed in filtered water until\ngreasiness has disappeared, when on its removal from the bichromate bath\nthe tissue is laid, without draining, upon it and pressed into contact\nwith the squeegee to remove the excess of liquid and, with it, the air\nbubbles interposited.  The tissue is then allowed to dry in the air on the\ncollodionized plate in the cold season, or, when the weather is warm and\ndamp, in a box in the bottom of which is placed a quantity of quicklime in\nearthen dishes.  When dry, the plates are placed one upon another, wrapped\nin paper and kept in a dry place.  When wanted for use the tissue is\nstripped off and will be found quite flat with a beautiful surface to\nprint upon.\n\nOne should avoid to keep the sensitized tissue in a moist and warm\natmosphere, for in less than ten hours it becomes insoluble even in\ncomplete darkness.  It should neither be kept in the air contaminated with\ngaseous reductive matters, such as the products of the combustion of coal\ngas and petroleum, sulphydric or sulphurous emanations from any source,\nthe fumes of turpentine oil, etc., which, by reducing the chromic salt,\ncause the insolubilization of gelatine, prevent the print to adhere on the\nsupport or the clearing of the image, which may even refuse to develop.\n\nThe sensitive tissue keeps well for three or four weeks in cool and dry\nweather, and no more than eight or ten days in summer unless well\ndesiccated and kept in a preservative box.  If kept too long the image\ncannot be developed.\n\n_The Photometer.—_The time of exposure is regulated by means of a\nphotometer.  Of all the photometers which have been devised for that\npurpose we do not know any one more practical than that suggested in 1876\nby Mr. J. Loeffler, of Staten Island. It is made as follows: On a strip of\na thin glass plate, 6×2 inches, make four or five negatives, 1½×1¼ inch,\nexposing each one exactly for the same period and developing in the usual\nmanner, but without any intensification whatever.  It is even advisable to\nreduce the intensity if they were opaque.  Fix, etc., and apply a good\nhard varnish.  Now cover the back of these negatives with strips of\nvegetable paper or transparent celluloid, or, better, of thin sheets of\nmica, in such a manner as there be one thickness on the second negative,\ntwo on the third, three on the fourth, etc., leaving the first one\nuncovered.   Then place on the whole a glass plate of the same size as the\nfirst and border like a passe-partout.\n\n_The Negatives.—_For the carbon process the negatives should be intenser\nthan those intended for printing out on silver paper.  However, good\nproofs may be obtained from any negatives, so to say, by varying the\nstrength of the bichromate solution, as, also, by _using the tissue\nfreshly sensitized for weak negatives,_ in order to obtain vigor, and _for\nstrong negatives, the tissue two or three days after its preparation,_\nwhen it yields better half tones.  Printing dodges are also resorted to.\nThat the most commonly employed consists to varnish the back of the\nnegatives with a matt varnish, or to stretch on the same a sheet of\nmineral paper upon which the retouches are made by rubbing graphite,\nchrome yellow, pink or blue colors to strengthen the shadows or the\nwhites, as the case requires.  As a rule, it is advantageous to cover the\nprinting frame with tissue paper, whatever be the quality of the\nnegatives.\n\nThe negatives should be bordered with deep yellow or orange-red paper to\nform what is termed a “safe edge” upon which should rest the tissue in\norder to prevent the margin from being insolubilized by the reductive\naction of light.  If this precaution were neglected it would be impossible\nto strip off the paper without tearing the proof when the tissue is\napplied on the support upon which the image is to be developed.\n\nBefore exposing it is advisable to ascertain what the printing qualities\nof the negative are by making on silvered paper a proof of it—_not\nover-printed—_and another of the photometer, both being exposed at the\nsame time and for the same period.  This done, compare the proof from the\nnegative cliché with those of the photometer, and mark the negative with\nthe number of that of the photometer to which it corresponds, stating the\nshade of the proof next to it; for example: _No. 2_; _No. 3 faint, or\ncommences to appear,_ etc.  This No. 2 and the observation will indicate\nthe intensity of the negative and serve as a guide for printing on the\ntissue, since, as before explained, the silver paper is practically of the\nsame sensitiveness as the tissue prepared for negatives of the ordinary\nintensity.\n\n_Exposure.—_To print, the tissue is laid over the negative, taking care\nthat it covers the safe edge, and a strip of silvered paper placed in the\nphotometer, then both the printing frame and the photometer are exposed to\nlight side by side.\n\nUnless the negative be weak, when more vigor is obtained by exposing in\nsunshine, the printing should be done in the shade.  It is a well-known\nfact that the part of the bichromated film corresponding to the half\ntones in the lights are not sufficiently impressed in comparison to the\nblacks while impressed in direct sun’s light in this as well as in the\ncollotype, photogravure and other processes with the chromic salts,\nbecause the luminous action through the bare glass, or nearly so, which in\nthe negative represent the shadows and half blacks, is more energetic in\nproportion than through the other parts, from which it results that these\nparts being most acted on are made deeply insoluble through the thickness\nof the film, and then require to be cleared by a treatment with water at a\nhigher temperature than the parts representing the half tints in the\nlights of the picture, which are but superficially and slightly insoluble,\ncan stand.\n\nFrom time to time during the exposure the print in the photometer is\nexamined, and when a certain picture is printed to a certain shade, or\nwhen the one next by commences to appear or is faintly printed, etc., the\nexposure of the tissue is sufficient.  This, as the reader has already\ninferred, is a matter of experience, the guide being the knowledge of the\nintensity negative tested as above explained.\n\n_Development.—_The carbon prints are developed either on a sheet of paper\nupon which it should remain (single or simple transfer), or on a provisory\nsupport to be afterwards transferred on paper or any other material\n(double transfer).\n\n_Simple Transfer.—_This process is quite simple: The impressed tissue and\na sheet of paper coated with alumed (insoluble) gelatine are immersed face\nto face in cold water, and when the tissue is softened both are removed,\none superposed on the other, and the whole, being placed on a glass plate\nand covered with a thin oil cloth, is firmly pressed into contact with the\nsqueegee.  The rationale of applying under water the tissue on the\ngelatinized paper is to avoid the interposition of air bubbles.\n\nTo operate by simple transfer the tissue should be impressed under a\nreversed negative.  The reason is obvious.\n\n_Double Transfer.—_By this method the carbon prints are generally\ndeveloped on porcelain or opal plates, which more easily than glass plates\npermit one to follow the progress of the development and to retouch the\nimperfections before transferring the picture on paper.\n\nIn order that the image does not adhere on the provisory support a little\nof the following mixture is spread over the plate, which is then pretty\nstrongly heated, and, when it has cooled down, polished lightly with a\npiece of white flannel to obtain a very thin and even layer free from\nstriæ.  If the plate has not been used before for the purpose in question,\nit should be waxed a second time in the same manner:\n\nYellow wax              4 parts\nRosin                   1 part\nTurpentine or benzine   250 parts\n\nThe plates can be developed on the plates so waxed, but for “full gloss,”\nthat is, for enameled pictures, a film of collodion is applied on the\nplates, which then, instead of being waxed, should to be simply flowed\nwith a solution of India rubber 1 to 100 of benzole:\n\nEther        250 parts\nAlcohol      250 parts\nCastor oil   1 part\nPyroxyline   5 to 6 parts\n\nWhen the plate is coated and the collodion film set, it is immersed in\nwater until greasiness has disappeared and wanted for use.  Then the\ntissue, previously soaked in water, is applied upon it (taking care to\navoid air bubbles) and squeezed, lightly at first, with some force\nafterwards, to insure a perfect contact.\n\nZinc plates are also employed as provisory supports instead of glass, opal\nor porcelain plates.   The modus operandi is exactly the same.(30) The\nplates should be well planed, free from scratches, etc., and well polished\nto obtain glossy pictures without one having recourse to a film of\ncollodion.  For matt pictures, i.e., without gloss whatever, the plate\nshould be finely granulated, and when waxing a very light pressure should\nbe exerted to remove the excess of wax, else it might be quite impossible\nto strip off the picture in transferring on paper.\n\nFor double transfer on biscuits, objects in alabaster, porcelain, wood,\nany even or curved rigid materials, flexible supports are employed to\ndevelop the pictures.  These supports are prepared by fastening albumen\npaper on a board and evenly brushing over the following hot compound,\nfiltered through flannel, which, when dry, is polished with a cloth:\nStearine   15 parts\nRosin      3 parts\nAlcohol    100 parts\n\nThe flexible supports should be waxed, then collodionized for full gloss,\nas the glass, porcelain and metallic plates.\n\nAnother method which the writer recommends is the following, due to Mr.\nSwan: Immerse a sheet of paper in a solution of India rubber, 4:100 of\nbenzole, and let dry, which requires a few minutes.  This is the flexible\nsupport.  Then after exposure, brush over the India rubber solution on the\ncarbon tissue, apply upon it the support when the benzole is evaporated,\nand pass the whole under a rolling press to secure adhesion, then develop.\nTo transfer, soak the proof in tepid water, apply it on the material\nprepared, as it will be explained further on, and when dry, imbue the\nsupport from the back with benzole, to soften the India rubber, and strip.\n\nTo dispense with a rolling press, the proof may be developed on lacquered\nvegetable paper prepared by immersion in a solution of 10 parts of red\nshellac in 100 parts of alcohol.  After developing the proof is coated\nwith alumed gelatine, and when dry transferred as usual. To strip off it\nsuffices to imbue the paper with alcohol in order to dissolve the shellac.\n\nWhen the picture must be transferred on small spaces or on small objects\nthe most simple method—the most effective, perhaps—is the following,\ndevised some years ago by the writer and now employed for the ornaments of\n“articles de Paris:” Prepare the provisory support as usual, but with a\nthicker film of collodion; then, after developing and coloring, if\nnecessary, the picture is coated with gelatine, to which may be added some\nzinc white or other colored substance to form a ground.  This dry, strip\noff, immerse the pellicle in water to soften the gelatine and transfer on\nthe material collodion side up.\n\nThe proofs should be developed within three or four hours after\ninsolation, for the luminons action continues pretty actively in the dark,\nand this for a long time; thus: a proof rightly exposed in the morning\nbehaves as one over-exposed if developed in the evening, and after a\ncertain period either can not be developed or refuses to adhere on the\nsupport.  However, the proofs can be kept for three weeks, may be more,\nbefore development, if the soluble bichromate be washed off, the tissue\nsponged and dried rapidly in the warm season.  This capital improvement is\ndue to Mr. Charles Brasseur.\n\nIt has been said that before being applied on the support the proof should\nbe immersed in water to soften the tissue.  The time which it should be\nallowed to absorb water has an importance which must not be neglected.  If\nit do not remain long enough to be soaked through, small invisible air\nbubbles are formed on its surface, and interposing themselves between the\nimage and the support, form minute, brilliant, silver-like spots on the\nfinished picture; and, if the temperature of the water is above 20 deg. C.\n(68 deg. Fahr.), the image will be more or less reticulated.  The\ntemperature depends a good deal of the softness of the gelatine; 15 deg.\nC. (59 deg. Fahr.) is safe, except, however, when the thermometer is in\nthe thirtieths (90th Fahr.), when the water should be cooled down a few\ndegrees lower, but not at the melting ice temperature, for then the proof\nwould not adhere well.  As a rule, the tissue should remain in the cold\nwater until it becomes flat and shows a tendency to curl up.  It is at\nthis very moment that it should be squeezed on the support.\n\nThe proofs should not be developed immediately after transferring.  The\nadherence is greater and the pictures finer and devoid of defects when the\ndevelopment is made half an hour, and even an hour, after.  If developed\ntoo soon the picture will be partly, and even entirely, washed off.\nHence, a number of transfers can be prepared beforehand, placing them,\nface to face one upon another, in order that the tissue does not dry,\nwhich is quite essential.\n\nTo develop, the plate, with the tissue adhering to it, is placed in water\nheated to 30 deg. C. (80 deg. Fahr.), where it is left rocking the tray\noccasionally until the paper rises up by itself at the corners, when\ntaking hold of it by one corner, it is stripped off, leaving behind the\nimage buried in soluble gelatine.  Should the paper offer any resistance\nwhatever, the gelatine should be allowed to become more soluble by\nincreasing the temperature of the water, or by a longer immersion.  There\nis, in fact, no objection to this.  The plate—and that is a good\nmethod—can be placed in an upright position in a tin box, made ad hoc, and\nleft therein in warm water until the paper detaches itself and the image\nis partly developed _and the bichromate washed off._  This done, the plate\nis held in an inclined position on a tray filled with water at 35 deg. C.\n(95 deg. Fahr.), which is dashed with a wooden spoon on the image to clear\nit from the non-acted-on gelatine.  Presently one can judge whether the\nexposure is right.  If it is too short, the half tints in the shadows are\nwashed off, unless the negative be too intense, when a similar effect also\noccurs in the whites.  If it is too long, either the image is with\ndifficulty cleared or remains undeveloped.  In the latter case, it is\nrecommended by some operators to increase the temperature of the\ndeveloping water to near the boiling point, and, for local clearing, to\npour it on.  This we find objectionable, for the half tints are easily\nwashed off.  A better process, when the picture can not be cleared by\nwater at 50 deg. (122 deg. Fahr.), or thereabout, is to use a solution of\ncommon salt at 5 or 6 per cent. of slightly warm water.(31) It is even\npreferable to finish the development in a tepid solution of potassium\nsulpho-cyanide, 12:100.  The dissolving action is long, but not only, as\nsaid above, the half tints are best preserved, but blistering  and local\nwashing-off are avoided.\n\nAfter development the plate is rinsed under the tap, then flowed two or\nthree times with a solution of chrome alum at 1 per cent. of water, then\nwashed, and finally allowed to dry spontaneously.\n\nIt is objectionable to use a strong solution of alum, and in it to immerse\nthe plate for any length of time; the gelatine is considerably\nhardened—which is not necessary—and more liable to crack by time in being\nthoroughly desiccated.  We discard the common alum which we found liable\nto produce a slight reticulation.\n\nTwo defects are complained of by the beginners, viz., the want of\nadherence of the deep blacks, and, especially, the isolated and fine lines\nwhen the picture is a reproduction of an engraving, a drawing, etc., and\nthe liability in half tone pictures of the delicate details being washed\nout.  The first defects are avoided by pouring a solution of boric acid on\nthe transitory support before applying the tissue and developing at a low\ntemperature with salted water.  The second from an imperfect knowledge of\nthe properties of gelatine acted on by light in presence of a salt of\nchromic acid.  One should bear in mind that the degree of solubility of\ngelatine so acted on, as also its degree of impermeability—which is\nimportant in certain processes of photogravure—is proportionate to the\ndegree of insolation; thus, when not impressed, bichromated gelatine\ndissolves in water heated to about from 25 to 30 deg. C. (77 to 80 deg.\nFahr.), and when acted on between 30 and 100 deg. C. (86 to 112 deg.\nFahr.), according as to the degree of insolation, that is, of reduction of\nthe chromic salt, the latter temperature being that of insolubility of the\nparts the most acted on.  The very delicate half tints do not, generally,\nstand a temperature higher than 35 deg. C. (95 deg. Fahr.), and,\ntherefore, as the degree of insolubility of the various parts cannot be\nascertained, a priori, it is advisable during the development to increase\ngradually the temperature of the water from this degree, and not to exceed\n45 deg. C. (113 deg. Fahr.), in order to obtain the most perfect result\nfrom a negative of good intensity.  Indeed, by placing the supports on a\nrack and immersing the whole in water heated to 30 to 35 deg. C. (86 to 95\ndeg. Fahr.), the image will clear up by itself to perfection in a certain\nperiod.  This method is excellent for proofs in lines.  Those from the\ngrained negatives employed in photogravure are still more perfectly\ndeveloped in a tepid solution of potassium sulphocyanate, since the\nimpressions wholly consist of insoluble parts (the lines) and gelatine not\nacted on.\n\n_Retouching.—_The retouches are easily made. They should be done before\ntransferring when working by the double transfer process.\n\nThe transparent spots, and any parts which should be altered, are\nretouched with the material of the tissue dissolved in warm water; the\nwhites are cleared with a scraper; and any parts which are not intense\nenough, or which should be blended by the addition of half tints, are\nworked on the proof—to which a tooth has been given by rubbing with\ncuttle-fish powder—by means of a stump and an appropriate color, a mixture\nof lamp-black and carmine, for example, in very fine powder.\n\nThe proofs can also be colored by chemical means (see further on), or with\nwater colors employed with a solution of chrome alum, 1 to 200 of water,\nor gilt, silvered or bronzed with metallic powders applied with the\ngilder’s size thinned with turpentine on the proof previously coated with\na thin layer of alumed gelatine.\n\n_Second Transfer.—_To transfer, a sheet of enameled or simple transfer\npaper is immersed in tepid water until the gelatine is softened and feels\nslippery to the fingers.  The support is then placed under water at\nordinary temperatures—not under 16 deg. C. (60 deg. F.)—for two three\nminutes, then rubbed with a camel brush to remove the air bubbles, which\nmight be formed on the surface of the image, when, without draining, the\ngelatinized paper is laid upon it, covered with the thin oil cloth, and\npressed into contact with the squeegee, commencing in the center to the\nsweep off the water, then repeating the operation for the other half, as\nexplained to apply the tissue on the provisory support.  When the whole is\nquite dry, which requires three or four hours, the edges are cut with a\npenknife and the whole stripped off.  It may happen that the proof is\ncovered with minute, silver-like brilliant spots, which are nothing else\nthan very small air bubbles interposited between the carbon proof and the\ntransfer paper. They are caused by the gelatine paper not having been\nsufficiently softened or not laid on the proof with proper care. The\ndefect may also arise from the transfer paper coated with not sufficiently\nthick gelatine.\n\nTo transfer on any rigid material, the proofs on flexible supports are\ncoated by floating on the following gelatine solution, then allowed to\ndry, and, when wanted for use, immersed in tepid water to soften the\ngelatine and secure adherence:\n\nGelatine                   50 parts\nWater                      400 parts\nSolution of chrome alum,   6 parts\n4:100\n\n_Development on Absorbing Materials.—_The development of carbon prints on\nabsorbent material—such as canvas and palettes to be painted in oil,\netc.—cannot be made in the ordinary manner on account of the impossibility\nto eliminate entirely the chromic salt which tinges the material yellow.\nTo turn the difficulty, it suffices to wash off in several changes of cold\nwater all the unaltered bichromate from the prints on their removal from\nthe printing frame, and to proceed as usual, or the prints can be allowed\nto dry and transferred at some future time.\n\nCanvas should be prepared by brushing with a solution of aqueous ammonia\nin alcohol, 5:20, to remove greasiness until the thread is apparent, and,\nwhen dry, rubbed with sand to grain it—or to give a tooth, as it is\ntermed—then rubbed dry with a solution of soluble glass, 1 to 10 of\nbeer.(32)\n\nPalettes should be rendered impervious, or nearly so, by flowing upon them\na solution of alumed gelatine, which is allowed to penetrate into the\npores of the wood and the excess scraped off when solidified, when the\nsurface may be whitened, if necessary, as for printing on wood box, q.v.\n\nOpals, porcelain, or ivory should be prepared with the following\nsubstratum:\n\nGelatine             50 parts\nWater                400 parts\nChrome alum, 4:100   6 parts\n\nVery fine carbon proofs having the appearance of pictures on opal plates\nare made by transferring in the following manner, devised by the author:\n\nDevelop on the ground surface of a glass or porcelain plate, well waxed,\nto obtain a matt picture, or in the ordinary manner for "full gloss," and\nwhen the image is retouched or colored, apply a thin coating of gelatine,\nlet dry and coat with the following opaque collodion:\n\nA.   Ether, conc.         100 parts\n     Alcohol, 95 deg      90 parts\n     Pyroxyline           7 parts\nB.   White zinc in very   9 parts\n     fine powder\n     Castor oil           3 parts\n     Alcohol              10 parts\n\nGrind in a mortar, adding ultramarine blue and carmine, or a little of any\nsuitable coloring matters, and mix to A. When the collodion is dry, which\nrequires a few hours, strip the whole or back with strong white or colored\npaper before stripping. A solution of gelatine with glycerine, white zinc,\netc., may be substituted for collodion when the pictures are employed as\nornaments on wood, etc. Carbon prints on celluloid are now made for\nsimilar purposes.\nOPAL GELATINE SOLUTION\nGelatine      150 parts\nGlycerine     15 parts\nZinc, white   40 parts\nWater         600 parts\n\nTo which some coloring matters may be added according to taste.  Grind the\nwhite with the glycerine and a little water, mix to the gelatine dissolved\nin the remainder of water, and filter through canvas.  Apply the mixture\nmoderately hot, 30 deg. C. (86 deg. Fahr.)\n\n_Transparencies.—_The transparencies are printed on a special tissue sold\nunder the name of “diapositive.”  It differs from the ordinary tissue in\nthis, that the mixture contains a greater quantity of the color matter,\nIndia ink, which is ground exceedingly fine.\n\nThe proofs for transparencies should be printed deeper than those to be\nseen by reflection, and developed on thin glass plates, free from any\ndefects, and coated with either one of the following substrata:\n\nSoluble glass   5 parts\nWhite of eggs   15 parts\nWater           20 parts\n\nThe whole is beaten up to a thick froth and allowed to subside, when the\nclear liquid is decanted, filtered through flannel and the glass plates\ncoated.  The substratum should be allowed to dry for a few hours, and\nrinsed under the tap before use.\n\nThe other substratum consists of\n\nGelatine             35 parts\nAcetic acid, No. 8   250 parts\nAlcohol, 95 deg      50 parts\nWater                700 parts\nChrome alum, 4:100   60 parts\n\nDissolve the gelatine in the acid at a moderate heat, add afterwards the\nalcohol and water, and lastly mix the chrome alum by small quantities at a\ntime.\n\nThese substrata are employed to avoid the peeling off of the image.  To\nprevent the entire desiccation of the gelatine, which is the cause of the\ndefect above alluded to, it is advisable to add glycerine to the washing\nwater after the image is cleared.  Some operators recommend a coating of\nflexible collodion, that is, prepared with castor oil, for the purpose in\nquestion.  We do not think that necessary when the transparencies are not\nexposed to sunshine.  If anything should be applied we would prefer the\nencaustic.\n\nCarbon transparencies are invaluable for reproducing negatives in the\noriginal size by the same (carbon) process, or for enlarging by the\ncollodion or gelatine process.  For these purposes they should be made on\nthe special red tissue manufactured by the Autotype Company, of London,\nEng.  They can, however, be made on the ordinary tissues.\n\nWhatever be the tissue employed, the transparencies for the reproduction\nof negatives are seldom opaque enough, and should be intensified.  This is\ndone by treating them with a very dilute solution of sodium permanganate,\nwhich colors them olive green.\n\nTransparencies for lantern slides, etc., are best colored with the\ncouleurs à l’albumine of L. Encausse, sold by J. Reygondaud, Paris\n(France).  They are transparent.(33)\n\n_Toning and Intensifying.—_The carbon proofs can be toned and at the same\ntime intensified by reagents acting with chromic oxide.\n\nThe dyes or coloring matters precipitated are not opaque, and, as a\nconsequence, not objectionable for transparencies.  The following\nprocesses are the most employed:\n\nPrepare three solutions as follows:\n\nA.   Ferric sulphate    5 parts\n     Water              100 parts\nB.   Sodium carbonate   2 parts\n     Water              100 parts\nC.   Gallic acid        5 parts\n     Water              100 parts\n\nDissolve the gallic acid in warm water.  Filter each solution.  They keep\nwell.\n\nTo tone, the plate is immersed for, say, ten minutes in A, then, after\nrinsing slightly, it is placed in B for the same period, rinsed again and\nflowed with C until the desired color is obtained.  The tone is a splendid\npurple black color.  If a solution of pyrogallol be substituted to that of\ngallic acid, the tone is green, and to a green bordering to black when a\nsolution of catechu is used, the catechu exerting at the same time a\ntanning action on the gelatine.  After toning, the plate should be\nthoroughly washed.\n\nA similar process consists to wet the plate under the tap, then to flow\nover a mixture by about equal volumes of\n\nA.   Ferrous sulphate     5 parts\n     Acetic acid, No. 8   5 parts\n     Water                100 parts, filter\nB.   Gallic acid          5 parts\n     Water                100 parts\n\nWhen toned, the plate is well washed, then flowed once with the alum\nsolution and again washed.  The tone by this process easily turns to an\ninky blue not very agreeable.  The action should be stopped a little\nbefore the desired color is obtained.\n\nIt sometimes happens that the image in drying intensifies more then\nnecessary.  It can be cleared with a solution of oxalic or citric acid.\n\nA brown sepia is obtained by toning first with potassium permanganate, 1\nper cent. of water, then, after washing, with a solution of pyrogallol.\nIf gallic acid be used instead of pyrogallol, the tone is black.  By this\nprocess a great intensity is obtained.  A dilute solution of ammonium\nsulphide can be employed as a clearing agent.\n\nPyrogallol and silver nitrate give a warm black tone.\n\nPotassium bichromate followed by silver nitrate form a brick-red\nprecipitate of some opacity.(34)\n\nChloride of nickel and potassium ferrocyanate produce a fine brown.\n\nLime water and alizarine dissolved in alcohol dye violet.\n\nAlizarine and the caustic alkalies produce a variety of tints, from violet\nto purple, according to the concentration of the solutions.\n\nLead acetate and alizarine in ammoniacal solution dye purple.\n\nPotassium ferrocyanide and uranium nitrate produce a warm sepia tone. With\nchloride of nickel the tone is brown.\n\nAmmoniacal solution of coralline diluted with water gives carmine red.\n\nPotassium bichromate and extract of indigo produce a fine greenish tone\nsuitable for landscapes.\n\nExtract of indigo colors blue(35)\n\nSome of these reactions can be applied to the printing processes with the\nbichromates, etc.  The paper should be coated with galatine.  See the\nAppendix.\n\nOther colorations can be obtained with dyes in utilizing (as shown by\nPersoz) chromous chromic oxide as a mordant: alizarine, Brazil and yellow\nwood (morus tinctoria), Fustet (rhus cotinus), etc.  The extent of this\nwork does not admit of describing the numerous processes which can be\nemployed; they will suggest themselves to the chemist.\n\nThe alkalies employed with the dyes should be employed in diluted\nsolutions, as being liable to produce reticulation.  By applying the\ncoloring matters and the mordants thickened with a little starch, the\nimage can be colored with different colors.  Lantern slides can be thus\ncolored with great ease.\n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF RED, YELLOW, OR BLUE TISSUES.\n\n\n_Red Tissue.—_Dissolve 10 grams of carmine in 1 liter of aqueous ammonia\nand evaporate.  When the smell of the alkali has almost disappeared, add 1\nliter of rain water.  Of this take 65 cubic centimeters, add 35 c.c.m. of\nrain water, and in the solution let soak for an hour 15 grams of very\nsoluble gelatine, add 1 gram of sugar, and dissolve in a water bath.\nFilter, and take of the mixture a sufficient quantity (25 c.c.m. for a\nsurface 18×24 centimeters) to cover a sheet of paper which has been\npreviously applied upon a glass plate in the following manner: In a tray\nfull of hot water, immerse the plate and the paper; remove the whole in\nsuch a manner as the paper remains in contact with the plate; rub out the\nexcess of water with a squeegee, and flow the gelatine over the paper\nstill damp.  Let cool on a leveled stand, and when the gelatine is\nsolidified to a consistent jelly, remove the paper from the plate and\nplace it to dry in an oven heated at not over 24 or 25 deg. C.\n\nIt is desirable that in drying the paper does not curl up.  To that end,\napply over it, before it being removed from the plate a wooden frame to\nwhich the gelatine, still sticky, will sufficiently adhere to hold the\ntissue when it stretches in drying.\n\n_Yellow Tissue.—_Pulverize to an impalpable powder 25 grams of light\nchrome yellow in tablets (water color), and gradually add in stirring 1\nliter of rain water.  Take 100 c.c.m. of this and into it let soak for an\nhour 15 grams of the same gelatine used for the red tissue, add 1 gram of\nsugar, then proceed as above.\n\n_Blue Tissue.—_In a liquid consisting of 85 c.c.m. of rain water and from\n12 to 15 c.c.m. of blue ink, such as sold by stationers, let soak for an\nhour 15 grams of the same gelatine and 1 gram of sugar, and proceed.\n\n_Preparation of Transfer Paper.—_Two kinds of transfer paper are\nemployed—the enamel and plain transfer paper.\n\nTo enamel the paper: Dissolve 100 parts of barium nitrate in 500 parts of\nwater, and, on the other hand, 200 parts of sodium sulphate in the same\nquantity of water.  Mix, wash well the precipitate—barium sulphate—by\ndecantation, and when well drained, mix to the following solution:\n\nGelatine, Coignet’s   300  parts\nGlycerine             80  parts\nUltramarine blue      1  part\nCrimson lake          0.1 part\nWater                 2,500  parts\n\nLet soak the gelatine for, say, one hour, dissolve by heat, then add by\nsmall quantities, stirring violently, 4 parts of chrome alum dissolved in\n250 parts of hot water.  Filter through flannel and coat the paper as\ndirected to prepare the tissue.  The mixture should be employed\nimmediately after adding the chrome alum.\n\nThe plain transfer paper is prepared in the same manner, leaving out the\nbarium sulphate and the coloring matters.\n\n_Preparation of the Silver Paper.—_Immerse the paper for two minutes in a\nsolution of—\n\nSodium chloride (common   2 parts\nsalt, dry)\nLemon juice               1 part\nWater                     100 parts (filter)\n\nWhen dry and wanted for use, sensitize the salted paper by floating for\none minute on—\n\nSilver nitrate   8  parts\nNitric acid      0.1 part\nWater            100  parts\n\nOn its removal from the silver bath, sponge the paper between sheets of\nblotting paper and hang it up to dry.\n\nENCAUSTIC FOR SINGLE TRANSFER PROOFS.\nWhite wax           25 parts\nMastic              3 parts\nTurpentine          100 parts\n\nDissolve by heat, first the mastic, then the wax, and keep for use in a\nlarge mouthed vial.\n\n      MATT VARNISH.\nSandarac        6 parts\nMastic          6 parts\nLavender oil.   0.5 parts\nEther           100 parts\n\nWhen dissolved, add 30 parts of benzine.  The opacity of the film varies\nwith the quantity of benzine added; by excess the varnish dries\ntransparent.\n\n         WATER COLORS WHICH RESIST THE ACTION OF LIGHT.\nRed.      Indian red.    Light red.\nOrange.   Mars yellow.\nBlue.     Cobalt blue.   French blue.   Smalt.         New blue.\nBrown.    Raw umber.     Burnt\n                         sienna.\nGreen     Terre verte.\nYellow.   Cadmium        Yellow         Roman ochre.\n          yellow.        ochre.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n\nAlthough we intended to only describe the printing processes without the\nuse of silver salts, we thought it would be well to complete this work by\ngiving the most practical and interesting processes ever published to\nobtain permanent photographs; as they may give rise in the hand of\nexperimenters to useful applications.\n\nFrom time to time processes are published under “queer” names, which are\nbased on the well known actions of reagents on the ferric salts reduced by\nlight.  They are derived from those described in the following pages.\n\nWe call specially the attention of the reader to the process of Poitevin,\nby which one can experiment with every ferric salts, citrate, lactate,\noxalate, tartrate, benzoate, etc., by simply exciting with the\ncorresponding acid.  Observe that to obtain good results the paper should\nbe strongly sized; it is a sine qua non, although not recommended by\nPoitevin.\n\n\n\nC.J. BURNETT’S PROCESS(1857).\n\n\n“A capital process for many purposes,” says Mr. Burnett, “is to float or\n_steep_ the paper in a mixed solution of bichromate of potash and sulphate\nof copper, as for Hunt’s chromotype process.(36) I have mixed gelatine, or\noccasionally grape sugar, or both with the solution;(37) but instead of\ndeveloping it with nitrate of silver, as in chromotype, wash out the salt\nunaltered by light, and develop by floating on a solution of ferrocyanate\nof potassium.  The purple red color of the copper salt which now forms the\npicture may be modified or changed in many ways,(38) viz., by soaking the\npicture, after the ferrocyanate of potassium has been washed out of the\nlights, in a solution of sulphate of iron.  Solutions of gallic acid,\ntannic acid with alkalies of carbonate, may also be employed to modify or\nchange the color.  This process has the advantage that one may regulate\nthe exact tone (black or useful neutral tint) to the greatest nicety by\nthe time we allow the print to remain in the iron toning bath.”\n\n\n\nGODEFROY’S PROCESS (1858).\n\n\nFloat the paper upon the following solution for three minutes and hang it\nup to dry:\n\nUranium nitrate   30 to 60 parts\nSilver nitrate    8 parts\nWater             100 parts\n\n(39)\n\nThe sensitiveness increases in proportion to the quantity of uranium\nnitrate.  With the above formula the paper can be exposed in the camera,\nor, for printing, under a negative cliché.\n\nIn printing an exposure of five seconds in diffused light gives an image\nperfectly visible, and a grayish black tone; ten seconds gives a vigorous\nimage almost of a black color; in from fifteen to twenty seconds the image\nis very strong, with the color of an engraving. In sunshine the action is\nnecessarily much more rapid.\n\nThe impression is developed by immersion in\n\nFerrous sulphate   8 parts\nTartaric acid      4 parts\nSulphuric acid     1 part\nWater              100 parts\n\nThe image is rapidly developed. It is fixed by washing in water.\n\n\n\nDE LA BLANCHERE’S PROCESS (1858).\n\n\nUranium nitrate   25 parts\nDistilled water   100 parts\n\nFilter the solution and keep it in the dark.\n\nThe paper should be sized with a gelatine solution at 5 per 100 of water,\nand, when dry, kept in the dark.(40) It is sensitized by floating five\nminutes.\n\nThe exposure under a negative varies from fifteen to twenty minutes in the\nshade, and from one to three minutes, at the most, in sunshine.  As a\nrule, it is advisable to somewhat underexpose in order that the\ndevelopment be regular, progressive, under control.\n\nThe image is developed by floating, or immersion in\n\nSilver nitrate       2 parts\nDistilled water      100 parts\nNitrate acid, C.P.   a trace\n\nWhen the image is intense enough it is washed in several changes of water,\nthen toned in a solution of gold at 1 per 1,000 of water acidified with\ntraces of hydrochloride acid.(41)\n\nThe following bath develops slowly, and gives very rich purple tones\nwithout toning:\n\nNitrate of silver    3 parts\nNitrate of uranium   1 part\nNitrate of cadmium   1 part\nAlcohol              10 parts\nWater                100 parts\nNitric acid          traces\n\n_The developing solutions should be as little acid as possible, but not\nneutral, for then the proofs would be veiled and grayish._\n\nThe image can also be developed in a solution of gold, or in a very weak\nsolution of mercuric chloride at 1 per 10,000.  The proof must be\nextremely well printed and left for from two to five minutes in the\nmercuric solution.  If the time of exposure is right, the image will\nchange but little in the solution, and will take, when treated with silver\nnitrate, the most splendid tones.\n\nThe proofs should be carefully washed when finished.  If they were\ndeveloped with silver, they must be immersed in diluted aqueous ammonia,\nwhich will perfectly clear the whites.  If developed with chloride of\ngold, the water should be heated to 60 to 80 deg. C. (140 to 176 deg.\nFahr.)\n\n\n\nHOUDOY’S PROCESS (1858.)\n\n\nThe paper is floated upon a lukewarm solution of gelatine at 5:100, and\nwhen dry, on a bath of uranium at 10 or 15 per 100 of water.  After\nexposure to the sun the image is developed with a solution of silver\nnitrate acidified with acetic acid.  The exposure varies, according to the\nnature of the negative, from one to ten minutes; it must be long enough\nfor the image being developed in from thirty to forty seconds.  It is then\nremoved from the silver bath and placed in the following:\n\nFerrous sulphate   3 to 8 parts\nAcetic acid        2 parts\nWater              100 parts\n\nIn this bath the image takes a great vigor and appears entirely on the\nsurface of the paper.  When the proof has been too long exposed it should\nbe washed slightly before placing it in the iron bath.  Developed, the\nimage is, generally, of a sepia tone, which can be turned to black by a\nsolution of chloride of gold, 1:1,000, washing afterwards as usual.\n\n\n\nNIÈPCE DE ST. VICTOR’S PROCESS (1859).\n\n\nRed Prints.\n\n\nFloat the paper for fifteen or twenty seconds on a 20 per cent. solution\nof nitrate of uranium and dry before the fire in the dark room.  This\npaper can be prepared many days before use.  Expose in sunshine from eight\nto ten minutes, according to the intensity of the light and the quality of\nthe negative, then wash in moderately warm water (50 to 60 deg. C.) for a\nfew seconds.  This done, immerse in a solution of red prussiate of potash\nat 2 per cent. of water; in a few moments the proof will become of a fine\nblood-red color, like “sanguine.”  Wash, etc.\n\n\nGreen Prints.\n\n\nMake a red print as above described, immerse it for a few minutes in a\nsolution of nitrate of cobalt and dry it without washing.  Fix then in a\nsolution of sulphate of iron at 20 per cent. of water and 4 of sulphuric\nacid.  Wash and dry before the fire.\n\n\nViolet Prints.\n\n\nPrepare the paper in the uranium bath, expose, wash and develop in a\nsolution of chloride of gold, 1:200, until the proof has assumed a fine\nviolet color.  Wash in several changes of water.\n\n\nBlue Prints.\n\n\nSensitize the paper with a red prussiate of potash solution at 20 per 100.\nLet dry, expose until the proof is slightly blue; immerse it for five or\nten seconds in a saturated solution of bichloride of mercury, wash only\nonce and immerse in a solution of oxalic acid—saturated when cold—heated\nto about 55 deg. C.  Wash in three or four waters and let dry\nspontaneously.\n\n\nBlack Prints.\n\n\nFloat the paper on a mixture by equal volumes of a solution of iron\nperchloride and another of uranium nitrate, each at 10 per 100 of water.\nExpose and develop on a saturated solution of gallic acid.\n\n\n\n                    DR. T.L. PHIPSON’S PROCESS (1861).\n\n\nTake a solution of perchloride of iron and, having precipitated the\nperoxide with ammonia, collect the precipitate on a filter and wash it\nwith boiling water.  Add the precipitate in excess to a warm solution of\noxalic acid.  A beautiful emerald green solution is obtained, which must\nbe a little concentrated by evaporation and then set aside in a dark room\nfor use.  The paper is floated for ten (?) minutes upon the green solution\nof ferric oxalate, to which has been added a little oxalate of ammonia and\nhung up to dry in the dark.\n\nExpose under a negative for from ten to twenty minutes, according to the\nweather, and wash well the paper with rain water.  Spring water will not\ndo on account of the lime it may contain, which will form oxalate of lime\nin the paper (insoluble).  When all the non-decomposed oxalate is washed\nfrom the proof, a feeble image of oxalate of protoxide of iron, scarcely\nvisible, is left on the paper.  To develop it and to obtain the vigor, the\ntone and color of silver prints proceed as follows:\n\nPlunge the proof for a little while in a (weak) solution of permanganate\nof potassium to which a few drops of ammonia have been added; in the bath\nthe image becomes brown and distinctly visible.  It is then withdrawn and\nimmersed in a solution of pyrogallic acid for half an hour, after which it\nis washed and dried.\n\nThe image thus obtained can hardly be distinguished from silver prints;\nthe tone is soft, brilliant and permanent.\n\nThis process is quite original and interesting.  The theory is as follows:\nUnder the action of light the ferric oxalate is reduced in the ferrous\nsalt, insoluble, which, after the print has been cleared from the ferric\noxalate, is oxidized and reduced into ferric oxide by the alkalized\npermanganate, the latter then forming colored compounds with reagents.\n\nIt has been lately published in England under the name of “kallitype,” a\nnew process—or old, ad libitum—which consists in developing the image in\nferrous oxalate by a peculiar silver compound whose formula is given\nbelow.  The paper is prepared by brushing with a strong solution of\nneutral ferric oxalate dried rapidly—which is a sine qua non when using\ndeliquescent salts; and after exposure the image is developed, etc.\n\nSilver nitrate         50 grains\nSodium citrate         800 grains\nPotassium bichromate   1 to 2 grains\nWater                  10 ounces\n\n“Dissolve the silver nitrate in 1 ounce of water, the citrate and\nbichromate in the remainder and mix.  The precipitate—silver citrate and\nchromate—is then dissolved by adding 1 dram of ammonia .880, and after 35\ndrops of strong nitric acid has been added the solution is ready for use.”\n\nThis process reminds us that of Robert Hunt (1842), and that of more\nrecent date (1863), of Borlinetto, who developed the image in black with a\nsilver nitrate alcoholic solution, 1:500, and after washing the picture in\na solution of citric acid, 1:10, fixed it by aqueous ammonia.  But,\nalthough that is not absolutely necessary, we would advise one working\nthis, or similar processes in which a silver salt is employed for\ndeveloping, to fix the image, after treatment with citric acid to clear\nthe proofs from iron salts, in a solution of ammonium sulphocyanate—which\nhas not the injurious effect of sodium thiosulphate (hyposulphite)—in\norder to prevent the paper to be tinged by the reduction of the silver\nnitrate which is mechanically retained in its fiber.\n\nThe solution of ammonium sulphocyanate should be compounded with auric\nchloride to tone the picture at the same time it is fixed; thus:\n\nAmmonium sulphocyanate   35   parts\nGold terchloride         0.15 part\nWater                    350   parts\n\nThe solution can be used over again.\n\nIn the processes devised by Dr. Phipson, Monckhoven and other authorities,\nthe double ammonio-ferric oxalate is rightly recommended instead of the\nsimple oxalate.  Not only is the preparation more sensitive to the\nluminous action, but better half tones are obtained. As usual, it is\nadvantageous to size the paper with starch.\n\nThe ammonio-ferric oxalate is prepared by precipitating ferric chloride or\nsulphate by aqueous ammonia, then washing the precipitate collected on a\nfilter until the washing water be neutral or does not evolve the smell of\nammonia.  The precipitate is then placed in an evaporating dish, and by\nsmall quantity is added a hot solution of ammonium oxalate until it is\nnearly (not entirely) dissolved, when the solution is set aside for a few\nhours, then filtered and evaporated to crystallization.  For use, the\ncrystals of ammonio-ferric oxalate are dissolved in the proportion of 1\nfor 5 of distilled water.  The solution as well as the crystals should be\nkept in the dark.\n\nIf one object to the trouble of crystallizing, the solution can be\nprepared by dissolving the ferric oxide in a hot solution of 30 parts of\nammonium oxalate and 25 parts of oxalic acid in 180 parts of water\nobserving that the oxide must be in excess.(42)\n\nThe following sensitizing solution gives also excellent results:\n\nAmmonio-ferric oxalate   10 parts\nAmmonio-ferric lactate   4 parts\nWater                    100 parts\n\nAfter exposure, which varies from five to ten minutes, according to the\nintensity of the light and the printing quality of the negatives, the\npicture appears negative from formation of ferrous oxalate.  It may be\ndeveloped in a great many ways: by a solution of silver nitrate at 2 or 3\nper cent. of water acidified slightly by an organic acid—citric acid, for\nexample—or a diluted solution of ammonio-nitrate of silver, which most\nlikely constitutes the best developer; the image is black and consists of\nmetallic silver and ferric oxide, with formation of silver oxalate, which\ndissolve in the ammonia.  If the print be treated by a weak solution of\naqueous ammonia, the image turns green, then brown, and if, before the\nlatter coloration is obtained, gallic acid or pyrogallol be added, the\nimage becomes bluish-black or brown-black. In the same circumstances\ntannin (gallo-tannin) produces a blue-black image; catechu-tannin(43) and\nquino-tannin give green, etc. Employed as a developer, potassium\nferricyanate develops an image in prussian blue, and auric chloride one in\nthe characteristic violet metallic gold.  To fix the images obtained by\nthe latter reactions, it suffices to wash them in a few changes of water,\nand, if developed with silver, they can be toned by any of the alkaline\nsolutions of auric chloride used in the printing out silver process, etc.\n\nThe photographs obtained by all these processes are permanent.\n\n\n\nDR. J.B. OBERNETTER’S PROCESS (1863).\n\n\nCopper chloride             100 parts\nFerric chloride, sol. sp.   13 parts\ngr. 1.5\nHydrochloric acid, conc.    12 parts\nC. P.\nWater                       1,000 parts\n\nFloat the paper on this solution for about two minutes and hang it up to\ndry.  The keeping quality of the prepared paper is remarkable; it has been\nkept for two years without apparent change; its sensitiveness is at least\none-third greater than that of silver albumen paper.  Unless developed\nwithin an hour or two, the vigor of the proof is much impaired; after\ntwenty-four hours a print can be taken over on the same.\n\nWhen exposed, only a faint image is visible.  It should be fixed in the\nfollowing solution:\n\nPotassium sulphocyanate   12 parts\nSulphuric acid, conc.     1 part\nSensitizing solution      10 to 12 parts\nWater                     1,000 parts\n\nA print is floated on this solution, face downward, for three or four\nminutes, taking care to agitate the liquid as little as possible; the\nprint is afterwards immersed and another one floated in its place, thus\nproceeding until all the prints are immersed or the solution can hold no\nmore.  A fresh solution is then added to strengthen it: the older the\nsolution the more rapidly and better it works.  In this developer copper\ncyanide is precipitated on the parts acted on by light, and this exactly\nin the proportion to the luminous action.  The time of immersion depends\non the method selected to finish the proofs; it its from five minutes to\nhalf an hour.  If the proof is immersed for, say, twenty-four hours, the\nimage comes out in a relief which may bring the shadows to two lines in\ndepth.  When well developed and thoroughly washed, the proof can be dried\nand the subsequent operations made at any convenient time.\n\nVarious processes may be employed to give to these proofs the tone\nrequired; thus: the prints well washed are placed in a solution of\nferricyanate of potassium at 6 to 12 per 100 of water, where they take a\nred color increasing in intensity.  If left over night the color becomes a\nsplendid velvet deep red with perfect clear whites.  To obtain the color\nof silver photographs one hour’s immersion is sufficient.  After this\noperation the proofs are washed until the water is no more tinged yellow.\n\nBy immersion in\nFerrous sulphate      100 parts\nIron sesquichloride   40 parts\nHydrochloric acid     80 parts\nWater                 200 to 300 parts\n\nthe proofs undergo the following gradation of colors: red, reddish violet,\nblue-violet, black and greenish black.  As soon as the desired color is\nobtained, the proofs are washed in acidified water and dried.\n\nThe most beautiful purple violet is obtained by leaving the proofs in the\niron solution until green-black, and then washing for a moment in a dilute\nsolution of sub-acetate of lead.\n\nA brown-black may be produced by treatment, after washing, with an\nammoniacal solution of hypermanganate of potash.\n\nA weak solution of nitrate of silver also yields very fine pictures, but\nthe exposure should be very short, and the proofs must be fixed in water\ncontaining a small quantity of oxalate of ammonia.\n\nIn order to impart to the proofs the gloss of silver photographs, they\nshould be albumenized in the ordinary manner, and the albumen\ninsolubilized by well known means.\n\nThe chemical actions in this process I explain in the following manner: On\nthe paper there are Fe2Cl3 and CuCl, the latter in excess.  By the action\nof light, and according to the transparency of the negative, Fe2Cl3 is\nreduced to FeCl, while CuCl suffers no alteration.\n\nIf the paper be immediately placed in an _absolutely_ dry room after\nexposure, the picture remains unchanged.  In a moist atmosphere FeCl\nattracts moisture and, with a part of CuCl, is so decomposed that Fe2Cl3\nis formed together with Cu2Cl.\n\nAfter this action has commenced, if the proof be not immediately immersed\nin a solution of sulphocyanate of potassium, Cu2Cl passes over to a higher\ncombination of chlorine, and the paper is again fit to be impressed anew\nby the action of light.\n\nAs long as FeCl or even Cu2Cl is present, if the print is immersed in the\nsulphocyanate solution, sulphocyanate of copper is immediately formed on\nthe reduced parts, while on the others the sulphocyanide of copper, formed\nand dissolved by the sulphocyanide of potassium in excess, becomes decom‐\nposed with water in soluble sulphocyanide of copper and deposited as such\non the parts already covered with the salt.\n\nFrequently the prints appear yellow from formation of the double\nsulphocyanide of copper, but the color disappears by washing in water.\nRed coloration is due to decomposition into ferrocyanide of copper.\n\n\n\nL. LIESEGANG’S PROCESS (1865).\n\n\nPour ammonia into a nitrate of uranium solution, wash the precipitate of\nuranate of ammonia in distilled water, then dissolve in citric acid.\n\nMix this solution of citrate of uranium and a little of a solution of\nchloride of gold with a paste prepared by dissolving tapioca in hot water.\nThe quantity of chloride of gold must be small and the heat not too great,\notherwise the gold would be reduced.\n\nSpread the mixture with a sponge on the paper, which takes a brilliant\nyellow color, and expose when quite dry; the proofs have the delicacy and\nvigor of albumen prints.\n\nThe proofs come from the frame with a bluish-black color; they should not\nbe toned, but merely fixed by washing until the yellow color of the paper\nhas disappeared.\n\nThe color of the picture can be changed to a purple by a solution of\nchloride of tin.\n\n\n\nGUARBASSI’S PROCESS (1867).\n\n\nThe paper is floated in the dark for four or five minutes on a saturated\nsolution of bichromate of potash.  When dry, it is printed a little longer\nthan for silver prints and afterwards floated, face upwards, on a water\nbath until all the unaltered bichromate is dissolved.  It is then immersed\nin the following solution, which improve by use and tones the pictures to\na reddish color:\n\nSaturated solution       4 parts\nnitrate of mercury, as\nfree from acid as\npossible\nSaturated solution       1 part\nbichromate of potash\nDistilled water          28 parts\n\nThis solution should be prepared, filtered and allowed to stand for some\ntime before use.  The print is left in the bath until it has assumed an\nintense red color, the whites remaining perfectly pure.  It is then washed\nand put in another bath to obtain a brownish tint.  This bath is thus\ncomposed:\n\nConc. aqueous ammonia   2 parts\nDistilled water         100 parts\n\nThe print must be immersed at once, and when, in a short time, it has\nassumed the proper color, it should be washed immediately.\n\nThe picture is toned in a very diluted solution of chloride of gold,\n1:7,000, in which the color passes from a light brown to a deep black or a\nviolet black tone, when it is washed in two changes of water.\n\n\n\nA. POITEVIN’S PROCESS (1870).\n\n\n“I use a paper prepared with iron sesquioxide rendered sensitive to light\nby tartaric or, better, citric acid in concentrated solution.  This paper,\nafter desiccation and exposure to light, possesses the property of\nreducing the solution of silver nitrate and that of chloride of gold, and\nof turning blue with a solution of potassium ferncyanate in the parts\nwhere light has reduced the iron sesquichloride into the oxide at the\nminimum.”\n\n“To coat the paper with an equal layer of iron sesqnioxide, I brush it\nwith a tuft of fine linen dipped in a solution of iron perchloride at 10\nor 12 per cent. of water, and dry the sheets in the dark.  I immerse\nafterwards these sheets, one after the other, in a tray containing aqueous\nammonia, in such a manner as to well wet each sheet successively.  A\nsufficient number of sheets being immersed, I pour off the ammonia in a\nvial, and, in the tray, I wash them several times, and remove them one by\none to hang them up to dry, even in full light, the iron sesquioxide not\nbeing sensitive to light.”\n\n“The paper can be prepared in quantities beforehand.  To use it I apply\nupon each sheet a solution of citric acid at 30 or 35 per cent. of\nwater(44)—which may be done by daylight—and let them dry in the dark.”\n\n“Exposed under a negative of the ordinary intensity, the paper is\nimpressed in sunshine in a few minutes; in the shade it requires about the\nsame time as chloride of silver paper.”\n\n“After exposure the image is not visible, and without being obliged to\nshelter it from light, I immerse the print in a solution containing about\n1 per cent. of silver nitrate.  This solution can be used over and over\nagain, by adding to it a little of the silver salt.  It does not become\nturpid by use; it simply turns slightly green from formation of iron\nnitrate.  The image appears soon and rapidly becomes vigorous; in half an\nhour it will be completely developed.  When the exposure is sufficient the\ncolor is deep sepia, but not so intense if the quantity of citric acid is\nfeeble.  No fixing is necessary; it suffices to wash in several changes of\nwaters.”\n\n“The image can be toned with great facility by a weak solution of gold or\nof platinum chloride, or, better, by a mixture of these two salts.  If the\nimpressed paper be treated by a very diluted solution of potassium\nferrocyanate, one obtains very pretty blue proofs.”\n\n“A weak solution of gold chloride develops a violet image. A solution of\nplatinum chloride has no effect.”\n\n“All the various phases of this printing method can be followed in full\n(diffused) light; there is only the desiccation of the paper when\nsensitized with citric acid, which requires to be done in the dark.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION PROCESSES***\n\n\n\nCREDITS\n\n\nDecember 24, 2007\n\n            Project Gutenberg edition 10\n            Martin Schub\n\n\n\nA WORD FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG\n\n\nThis file should be named 24016-0.txt or 24016-0.zip.\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n\n\n    http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/0/1/24016/\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one — the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

A.\n\nEASTER, 1914.\n\n\n\n\nJANUARY\n\nTHE PHEASANT\n\n\n\n\nTHE PHEASANT\n\n\nAs birds are to be considered throughout these pages from any standpoint\nbut that of sport, much that is of interest in connection with a bird\nessentially the sportsman\'s must necessarily be omitted. At the same\ntime, although this gorgeous creature, the chief attraction of social\ngatherings throughout the winter months, appeals chiefly to the men who\nshoot and eat it, it is not uninteresting to the naturalist with\nopportunities for studying its habits under conditions more favourable\nthan those encountered when in pursuit of it with a gun.\n\nIn the first place, with the probable exception of the swan, of which\nsomething is said on a later page, the pheasant stands alone among the\nbirds of our woodlands in its personal interest for the historian. It is\nnot, in fact, a British bird, save by acclimatisation, at all, and is\ngenerally regarded as a legacy of the Romans. The time and manner of its\nintroduction into Britain are, it is true, veiled in obscurity. What we\nknow, on authentic evidence, is that the bird was officially recognised\nin the reign of Harold, and that it had already come under the ægis of\nthe game laws in that of Henry I, during the first year of which the\nAbbot of Amesbury held a licence to kill it, though how he contrived\nthis without a gun is not set forth in detail. Probably it was first\ntreed with the aid of dogs and then shot with bow and arrow. The\noriginal pheasant brought over by the Romans, or by whomsoever may have\nbeen responsible for its naturalisation on English soil, was a\ndark-coloured bird and not the type more familiar nowadays since its\nfrequent crosses with other species from the Far East, as well as with\nseveral ornamental types of yet more recent introduction.\n\nIn tabooing the standpoint of sport, wherever possible, from these\nchapters, occasional reference, where it overlaps the interests of the\nfield-naturalist, is inevitable. Thus there are two matters in which\nboth classes are equally concerned when considering the pheasant. The\nfirst is the real or alleged incompatibility of pheasants and foxes in\nthe same wood. The question of rivalry between pheasant and fox, or (as\nI rather suspect) between those who shoot the one and hunt the other,\nadmits of only one answer. The fox eats the pheasant; the pheasant is\neaten by the fox. This not very complex proposition may read like an\nexcerpt from a French grammar, but it is the epitome of the whole\nargument. It is just possible--we have no actual evidence to go on--that\nunder such wholly natural conditions as survive nowhere in rural England\nthe two might flourish side by side, the fox taking occasional toll of\nits agreeably flavoured neighbours, and the latter, we may suppose,\ntheir wits sharpened by adversity, gradually devising means of keeping\nout of the robber\'s reach. In the artificial environment of a hunting or\nshooting country, however, the fox will always prove too much for a bird\ndulled by much protection, and the only possible _modus vivendi_ between\nthose concerned must rest on a policy of give and take that deliberately\nignores the facts of the case.\n\nMore interesting, on academic grounds at any rate, is the process of\neducation noticeable in pheasants in parts of the country where they\nare regularly shot. Sport is a great educator. Foxes certainly, and\nhares probably, run the faster for being hunted. Indeed the fox appears\nto have acquired its pace solely as the result of the chase, since it\ndoes not figure in the Bible as a swift creature. The genuine wild\npheasant in its native region, a little beyond the Caucasus, is in all\nprobability a very different bird from its half-domesticated kinsman in\nBritain. I have been close to its birthplace, but never even saw a\npheasant there. We are told, on what ground I have been unable to trace,\nthat the polygamous habit in these birds is a product of artificial\nenvironment; but what is even more likely is that the true wild pheasant\nof Western Asia (and not the acclimatised bird so-called in this\ncountry) trusts much less to its legs than our birds, which have long\nsince learnt that there is safety in running. Moreover, though it\nprobably takes wing more readily, it is doubtful whether it flies as\nfast as the pace, something a little short of forty miles an hour, that\nhas been estimated as a common performance in driven birds at home.\n\nThe pheasant is in many respects a very curious bird. At the threshold\nof life, it exhibits, in common with some of its near relations, a\nprecocity very unusual in its class; and the readiness with which\npheasant chicks, only just out of the egg, run about and forage for\nthemselves, is astonishing to those unused to it. Another interesting\nfeature about pheasants is the extraordinary difference in plumage\nbetween the sexes, a gap equalled only between the blackcock and greyhen\nand quite unknown in the partridge, quail and grouse. Yet every now and\nagain, as if resentful of this inequality of wardrobe, an old hen\npheasant will assume male plumage, and this epicene raiment indicates\nbarrenness. Ungallant feminists have been known to cite the case of the\n"mule" pheasant as pointing a moral for the females of a more highly\norganised animal.\n\nThe question of the pheasant\'s natural diet, more particularly where\nthis is not liberally supplemented from artificial sources, brings the\nsportsman in conflict with the farmer, and a demagogue whose zeal\noccasionally outruns his discretion has even endeavoured to cite the\nmangold as its staple food. This, however, is political, and not natural\nhistory. Although, however, like all grain-eating birds, the pheasant is\nno doubt capable of inflicting appreciable damage on cultivated land, it\nseems to be established beyond all question that it also feeds greedily\non the even more destructive larva of the crane-fly, in which case it\nmay more than pay its footing in the fields. The foodstuff most fatal to\nitself is the yew leaf, for which, often with fatal results, it seems to\nhave an unconquerable craving. The worst disease, however, from which\nthe pheasant suffers is "gapes," caused by an accumulation of small red\nworms in the windpipe that all but suffocate the victim.\n\nReference has been made to the bird\'s great speed in the air, as well as\nto its efficiency as a runner. It remains only to add that it is also a\ncreditable swimmer and has been seen to take to water when escaping from\nits enemies.\n\nThe polygamous habit has been mentioned. Ten or twelve eggs, or more,\nare laid in the simple nest of leaves, and this is generally placed on\nthe ground, but occasionally in a low tree or hedge, or even in the\ndisused nest of some other bird.\n\nComparatively few of the birds referred to in the following pages appeal\nstrongly to the epicure, but the pheasant, if not, perhaps, the most\nesteemed of them, is at least a wholesome table bird. It should,\nhowever, always be eaten with chip potatoes and bread sauce, and not in\nthe company of cold lettuce. Those who insist on the English method of\nserving it should quote the learned Freeman, who, when confronted with\nthe Continental alternative, complained bitterly that he was not a\nsilkworm!\n\n\n\n\nFEBRUARY\n\nTHE WOODCOCK\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOODCOCK\n\n\nThere are many reasons why the woodcock should be prized by the winter\nsportsman more than any other bird in the bag. In the first place, there\nis its scarcity. Half a dozen to every hundred pheasants would in most\nparts of the country be considered a proportion at which none could\ngrumble, and there are many days on which not one is either seen or\nshot. Again, there is the bird\'s twisting flight, which, particularly\ninside the covert, makes it anything but an easy target. Third and last,\nit is better to eat than any other of our wild birds, with the possible\nexception of the golden plover. Taking one consideration with another,\nthen, it is not surprising that the first warning cry of "Woodcock\nover!" from the beaters should be the signal for a sharp and somewhat\nerratic fusillade along the line, a salvo which the beaters themselves\nusually honour by crouching out of harm\'s way, since they know from\nexperience that even ordinarily cool and collected shots are sometimes\napt to be fired with a sudden zeal to shoot the little bird, which may\ncost one of them his eyesight. According to the poet,\n\n    "Lonely woodcocks haunt the watery glade;"\n\nand so no doubt they do at meal-time after sunset, but we are more used\nto flushing them amid dry bracken or in the course of some frozen ditch.\nQuite apart, however, from its exhilarating effect on the sportsman, the\nbird has quieter interests for the naturalist, since in its food, its\nbreeding habits, its travels, and its appearance it combines more\npeculiarities than perhaps any other bird, certainly than any other of\nthe sportsman\'s birds, in these islands. It is not, legally speaking, a\ngame bird and was not included in the Act of 1824, but a game licence is\nrequired for shooting it, and it enjoys since 1880 the protection\naccorded to other wild birds. This is excellent, so far as it goes, but\nit ought to be protected during the same period as the pheasant,\nparticularly now that it is once more established as a resident species\nall over Britain and Ireland.\n\nThis new epoch in the history of its adventures in these islands is the\nwork of the Wild Birds\' Protection Acts. In olden times, when half of\nBritain was under forest, and when guns were not yet invented that could\n"shoot flying," woodcocks must have been much more plentiful than they\nare to-day. In those times the bird was taken on the ground in springes\nor, when "roding" in the mating season, in nets, known as "shots," that\nwere hung between the trees. When the forest area receded, the resident\nbirds must have dwindled to the verge of extinction, for on more than\none occasion we find even a seasoned sportsman like Colonel Hawker\nworked up to a rare pitch of excitement after shooting woodcock in a\npart of Hampshire where in our day these birds breed regularly. Thanks,\nhowever, to the protection afforded by the law, there is once again\nprobably no county in England in which woodcocks do not nest.\n\nAt the same time, it is as an autumn visitor that, with the first of the\neast wind in October or November, we look for this untiring little\ntraveller from the Continent. Some people are of opinion that since it\nhas extended its residential range fewer come oversea to swell the\nnumbers, but the arrivals are in some years considerable, and if a\nstricter watch were kept on unlicensed gunners along the foreshore of\nEast Anglia, very much larger numbers would find their way westwards\ninstead of to Leadenhall. As it is, the wanderers arrive, not\nnecessarily, as has been freely asserted, in poor condition, but always\ntired out by their journey, and numbers are secured before they have\ntime to recover their strength. Yet those which do recover fly right\nacross England, some continuing the journey to Ireland, and stragglers\neven, with help no doubt from easterly gales, having been known to reach\nAmerica.\n\nThe woodcock is interesting as a parent because it is one of the very\nfew birds that carry their young from place to place, and the only\nBritish bird that transports them clasped between her legs. A few\nothers, like the swans and grebes, bear the young ones on the back, but\nthe woodcock\'s method is unique. Scopoli first drew attention to his own\nversion of the habit in the words "_pullos rostro portat_," and it was\nold Gilbert White who, with his usual eye to the practical, doubted\nwhether so long and slender a bill could be turned to such a purpose.\nMore recent observation has confirmed White\'s objection and has\nestablished the fact of the woodcock holding the young one between her\nthighs, the beak being apparently used to steady her burden. Whether the\nlittle ones are habitually carried about in this fashion, or merely on\noccasion of danger, is not known, and indeed the bird\'s preference for\nactivity in the dusk has invested accurate observation of its habits\nwith some difficulty. Among well-known sportsmen who were actually so\nfortunate as to have witnessed this interesting performance, passing\nmention may be made of the late Duke of Beaufort, the Hon. Grantley\nBerkeley, and Sir Ralph Payne-Gallwey.\n\nReference has already been made to the now obsolete use of nets for the\ncapture of these birds when "roding." The cock-shuts, as they were\ncalled, were spread so as to do their work after sundown, and this is\nthe meaning of Shakespeare\'s allusion to "cock-shut time." This "roding"\nis a curious performance on the part of the males only, and it bears\nsome analogy to the "drumming" of snipe. It is accompanied indeed by the\nsame vibrating noise, which may be produced from the throat as well,\nbut is more probably made only by the beating of the wings. There\nappears to be some divergence of opinion as to its origin in both birds,\nthough in that of the snipe such sound authorities as Messrs. Abel\nChapman and Harting are convinced that it proceeds from the quivering of\nthe primaries, as the large quill-feathers of the wings are called.\nOther naturalists, however, have preferred to associate it with the\nspreading tail-feathers. Whether these eccentric gymnastics are\nperformed as displays, with a view to impressing admiring females, or\nwhether they are merely the result of excitement at the pairing season\ncannot be determined. It is safe to assume that they aim at one or other\nof these objects, and further no one can go with any certainty. The word\n"roding" is spelt "roading" by Newton, who thus gives the preference to\nthe Anglo-Saxon description of the aërial tracks followed by the bird,\nover the alternative derivation from the French "roder," which means to\nwander. The flight is at any rate wholly different from that to which\nthe sportsman is accustomed when one of these birds is flushed in\ncovert. In the latter case, either instinct or experience seems to have\ntaught it extraordinary tricks of zigzag man[oe]uvring that not seldom\nsave its life from a long line of over-anxious guns; though out in the\nopen, where it generally flies in a straight line for the nearest\ncovert, few birds of its size are easier to bring down. Fortunately, we\ndo not in England shoot the bird in springtime, the season of "roding,"\nbut the practice is in vogue in the evening twilight in every\nContinental country, and large bags are made in this fashion.\n\nIn its hungry moments the woodcock, like the snipe, has at once the\nadvantages and handicap of so long a beak. On hard ground, in a long\nspell of either drought or frost, it must come within measurable\ndistance of starvation, for its only manner of procuring its food in\nnormal surroundings is to thrust its bill deep into the soft mud in\nsearch of earthworms. The bird does not, it is true, as was once\ncommonly believed, live by suction, or, as the Irish peasants say in\nsome parts, on water, but such a mistake might well be excused in anyone\nwho had watched the bird\'s manner of digging for its food in the ooze.\nThe long bill is exceedingly sensitive at the tip, and in all\nprobability, by the aid of a tactile sense more highly developed than\nany other in our acquaintance, this organ conveys to its owner the\nwhereabouts of worms wriggling silently down out of harm\'s way. On first\nreaching Britain, the woodcock remains for a few days on the seashore to\nrecover from its crossing, and at this time of rest it trips over the\nwet sand, generally in the gloaming, and picks up shrimps and such other\nsoft food as is uncovered between tidal marks. It is not among the\neasiest of birds to keep for any length of time in captivity, but if due\nattention be paid to its somewhat difficult requirements in the way of\nsuitable food, success is not unattainable. On the whole, bread and milk\nhas been found the best artificial substitute for its natural diet. With\nthe _kiwi_ of New Zealand, a bird not even distantly related to the\nwoodcock, and a cousin rather of the ostrich, but equipped with much the\nsame kind of bill as the subject of these remarks, an even closer\nimitation of the natural food has been found possible in menageries.\nThe bill of the _kiwi_, which has the nostrils close to the tip, is even\nmore sensitive than that of the woodcock and is employed in very similar\nfashion. At Regent\'s Park the keeper supplies the bird with fresh worms\nso long as the ground is soft enough for spade-work. They are left in a\npan, and the _kiwi_ eats them during the night. In winter, however, when\nworms are not only hard to come by in sufficient quantity but also\nfrost-bitten and in poor condition, an efficient substitute is found in\nshredded fillet steak, which, whether it accepts it for worms or not,\nthe New Zealander devours with the same relish.\n\nWhen a woodcock lies motionless among dead leaves, it is one of the most\nstriking illustrations of protective colouring to be found anywhere.\nTime and again the sportsman all but treads on one, which is betrayed\nonly by its large bright eye. There are men who, in their eagerness to\nadd it to the bag, do not hesitate in such circumstances to shoot a\nwoodcock on the ground, but a man so fond of ground game should\ncertainly be refused a game licence and should be allowed to shoot\nnothing but rabbits.\n\n\n\n\nMARCH\n\nTHE WOODPIGEON\n\n\n\n\nTHE WOODPIGEON\n\n\nThe woodpigeon is many things to many men. To the farmer, who has some\nclaim to priority of verdict, it is a curse, even as the rabbit in\nAustralia, the lemming in Norway, or the locust in Algeria. The tiller\nof the soil, whose business brings him in open competition with the\nnatural appetites of such voracious birds, beasts, or insects, regards\nhis rivals from a standpoint which has no room for sentiment; and the\nwoodpigeons are to our farmers, particularly in the well-wooded\ndistricts of the West Country, even as Carthage was to Cato the Censor,\nsomething to be destroyed.\n\nIt is this attitude of the farmer which makes the woodpigeon\npre-eminently the bird of February. All through the shooting season just\nended, a high pigeon has proved an irresistible temptation to the guns,\nwhether cleaving the sky above the tree-tops, doubling behind a broad\nelm, or suddenly swinging out of a gaunt fir. Yet it is in February,\nwhen other shooting is at an end and the coverts no longer echo the\nfusillade of the past four months, that the farmers, furious at the\nsight of green root-crops grazed as close as by sheep and of young\nclover dug up over every acre of their tilling, welcome the co-operation\nof sportsmen glad to use up the balance of their cartridges in organised\npigeon battues. These gatherings have, during the past five years,\nbecome an annual function in parts of Devonshire and the neighbouring\ncounties, and if the bag is somewhat small in proportion to the guns\nengaged, a wholesome spirit of sport informs those who take part, and\nthere is a curiously utilitarian atmosphere about the proceedings.\nEveryone seems conscious that, in place of the usual idle pleasure of\nthe covert-side or among the turnips, he is out for a purpose, not\nmerely killing birds that have been reared to make his holiday, but\nactually helping the farmers in their fight against Nature. As,\nmoreover, recent scares of an epidemic not unlike diphtheria have\nprecluded the use of the birds for table purposes, the powder is burnt\nwith no thought of the pot.\n\nThe usual plan is to divide the guns in small parties and to post these\nin neighbouring plantations or lining hedges overlooking these spinneys.\nAt a given signal the firing commences and is kept up for several hours,\na number of the marauders being killed and the rest so harried that many\nof them must leave the neighbourhood, only to find a similar warm\nwelcome across the border. Some such concerted attack has of late years\nbeen rendered necessary by the great increase in the winter invasion\nfrom overseas. It is probable that, as most writers on the subject\ninsist, the wanderings of these birds are for the most part restricted\nto these islands and are mere food forays, like those which cause\nlocusts to desert a district that they have stripped bare for pastures\nnew. At the same time, it seems to be beyond all doubt the fact that\nhuge flocks of woodpigeons reach our shores annually from Scandinavia,\nand their inroads have had such serious results that it is only by joint\naction that their numbers can be kept under. For such work February is\nobviously the month, not only because most of their damage to the\ngrowing crops and seeds is accomplished at this season, but also\nbecause large numbers of gunners, no longer able to shoot game, are thus\nat the disposal of the farmers and only too glad to prolong their\nshooting for a few weeks to such good purpose.\n\nMany birds are greedy. The cormorant has a higher reputation of the sort\nto live up to than even the hog, and some of the hornbills, though less\nfamiliar, are endowed with Gargantuan appetites. Yet the ringdove could\nprobably vie with any of them. Mr. Harting mentions having found in the\ncrop of one of these birds thirty-three acorns and forty-four\nbeech-nuts, while no fewer than 139 of the latter were taken, together\nwith other food remains, from another. It is no uncommon experience to\nsee the crop of a woodpigeon that is brought down from a great height\nburst, on reaching the earth, with a report like that of a pistol, and\nscatter its undigested contents broadcast. Little wonder then, that the\nfarmers welcome the slaughter of so formidable a competitor! It is one\nof their biggest customers, and pays nothing for their produce. One told\nme, not long ago, that the woodpigeons had got at a little patch of\nyoung rape, only a few acres in all, which had been uncovered by the\ndrifting snow, and had laid it as bare as if the earth had never been\nplanted. Seeing what hearty meals the woodpigeon makes, it is not\nsurprising that it should sometimes throw up pellets of undigested\nmaterial. This is not, however, a regular habit, as in the case of hawks\nand owls, and is rather, perhaps, the result of some abnormally\nirritating food.\n\nPigeons digest their food with the aid of a secretion in the crop, and\nit is on this soft material, popularly known as "pigeons\' milk," that\nthey feed their nestlings. This method suggests analogy to that of the\npetrels, which rear their young on fish-oil partly digested after the\nsame fashion. Indeed, all the pigeons are devoted parents. Though the\nmajority build only a very pretentious platform of sticks for the two\neggs, they sit very close and feed the young ones untiringly. Some of\nthe pigeons of Australia, indeed, go even further. Not only do they\nbuild a much more substantial nest of leafy twigs, but the male bird\nactually sits throughout the day, such paternal sense of duty being all\nthe more remarkable from the fact that these pigeons of the Antipodes\nusually lay but a single egg. Australia, with the neighbouring islands,\nmust be a perfect paradise for pigeons, since about half of the species\nknown to science occur in that region only. The wonga-wonga and\nbronze-wing and great fruit-pigeons are, like the "bald-pates" of\nJamaica, all favourite birds with sportsmen, and some of the birds are\nfar more brightly coloured than ours. It is, however, noticeable that\neven the gayest Queensland species, with wings shot with every prismatic\nhue, are dull-looking birds seen from above, and the late Dr. A. R.\nWallace regarded this as affording protection against keen-eyed hawks on\nthe forage. His ingenious theory receives support from the well-known\nfact that in many of the islands, where pigeons are even more plentiful,\nbut where also hawks are few, the former wear bright clothes on their\nback as well.\n\nThe woodpigeon has many names in rural England. That by which it is\nreferred to in the foregoing notes is not, perhaps, the most\nsatisfactory, since, with the possible exception of the smaller\nstock-dove, which lays its eggs in rabbit burrows, and the rock-dove,\nwhich nests in the cliffs, all the members of the family need trees, if\nonly to roost and nest in. A more descriptive name is that of ringdove,\neasily explained by the white collar, but the bird is also known as\ncushat, queest, or even culver. The last-named, however, which will be\nfamiliar to readers of Tennyson, probably alludes specifically to the\nrock-dove, as it undoubtedly gave its name to Culver Cliff, a prominent\nlandmark in the Isle of Wight, where these birds have at all times been\nsparingly in evidence.\n\nThe ringdove occasionally rears a nestling in captivity, but it does not\nseem, at any time of life, to prove a very attractive pet. White found\nit strangely ferocious, and another writer describes it as listless and\nuninteresting. The only notable success on record is that scored by St.\nJohn, who set some of the eggs under a tame pigeon and secured one\nsurvivor that appears to have grown quite tame, but was, unfortunately,\neaten by a hawk. At any rate, it did its kind good service by enlisting\non their side the pen of the most ardent apologist they have ever had.\nIndeed, St. John did not hesitate to rate the farmers soundly for\npersecuting the bird in wilful ignorance of its unpaid services in\nclearing their ground of noxious weeds. Yet, however true his eloquent\nplea may have been in respect of his native Lothian, there would be some\ndifficulty in persuading South Country agriculturists of the\nwoodpigeon\'s hidden virtues. To those, however, who do not sow that they\nmay reap, the subject of these remarks has irresistible charm. There is\ndoubtless monotony in its cooing, yet, heard in a still plantation of\nfirs, with no other sound than perhaps the distant call of a shepherd or\nbarking of a farm dog, it is a music singularly in harmony with the\npeaceful scene. The arrowy flight of these birds when they come in from\nthe fields at sundown and fall like rushing waters on the tree-tops is\nan even more memorable sound. To the sportsman, above all, the\nwoodpigeon shows itself a splendid bird of freedom, more cunning than\nany hand-reared game bird, swifter on the wing than any other purely\nwild bird, a welcome addition to the bag because it is hard to shoot in\nthe open, and because in life it was a sore trial to a class already\nharassed with their share of this life\'s troubles.\n\n\n\n\nAPRIL\n\nBIRDS IN THE HIGH HALL GARDEN\n\n\n\n\nBIRDS IN THE HIGH HALL GARDEN\n\n\nAll March the rooks were busy in the swaying elms, but it is these\nsofter evenings of April, when the first young leaves are beginning to\nframe the finished nests, and the boisterous winds of last month no\nlonger drown the babble of the tree-top parliament at the still hour\nwhen farm labourers are homing from the fields, that the rooks\npeculiarly strike their own note in the country scene. There is no good\nreason to confuse these curious and interesting fowl with any other of\nthe crow family. Collectively they may be recognised by their love of\nfellowship, for none are more sociable than they. Individually the rook\nis stamped unmistakably by the bald patch on the face, where the\nfeathers have come away round the base of the beak. The most generally\naccepted explanation of this disfigurement is the rook\'s habit of\nthrusting its bill deep in the earth in search of its daily food. This,\non the face of it, looks like a reasonable explanation, but it should be\nborne in mind that not only do some individual rooks retain through\nlife the feathers normally missing, but that several of the rook\'s\ncousins dip into Nature\'s larder in the same fashion without suffering\nany such loss. However, the featherless patch on the rook\'s cheeks\nsuffices, whatever its cause, as a mark by which to recognise the bird\nliving or dead.\n\nUnlike its cousin the jackdaw, which commonly nests in the cliffs, the\nrook is not, perhaps, commonly associated with the immediate\nneighbourhood of the sea, but a colony close to my own home in\nDevonshire displays sufficiently interesting adaptation to estuarine\nconditions to be worth passing mention. Just in the same way that gulls\nmake free of the wireworms on windswept ploughlands, so in early summer\ndo the old rooks come sweeping down from the elms on the hill that\noverlooks my fishing ground and take their share of cockles and other\nmuddy fare in the bank uncovered by the falling tide. Here, in company\nwith gulls, turnstones, and other fowl of the foreshore, the rooks strut\nimportantly up and down, digging their powerful bills deep in the ooze\nand occasionally bullying weaker neighbours out of their hard-earned\nspoils. The rook is a villain, yet there is something irresistible in\nthe effrontery with which one will hop sidelong on a gorging gull, which\nbeats a hasty retreat before its sable rival, leaving some half-prized\nshellfish to be swallowed at sight or carried to the greedy little beaks\nin the tree-tops. While rooks are far more sociable than crows, the two\nare often seen in company, not always on the best of terms, but usually\nin a condition suggestive of armed neutrality. An occasional crow visits\nmy estuary at low tide, but, though the bird would be a match for any\nsingle rook, I never saw any fighting between them. Possibly the crow\nfeels its loneliness and realises that in case of trouble none of its\nbrothers are there to see fair play. Yet carrion crows, like herons, are\namong the rook\'s most determined enemies, and cases of rookeries being\ndestroyed by both birds are on record. On the other hand, though the\nheron is the far more powerful bird of the two, heronries have likewise\nbeen scattered, and their trees appropriated, by rooks, probably in\noverwhelming numbers. Of the two the heron is, particularly in the\nvicinity of a preserved trout stream, the more costly neighbour. Indeed\nit is the only other bird which nests in colonies of such extent, but\nthere is this marked difference between herons and rooks, that the\nformer are sociable only in the colony. When away on its own business,\nthe heron is among the most solitary of birds, having no doubt, like\nmany other fishermen, learnt the advantage of its own company.\n\nOne of the most remarkable habits in the rook is that of visiting the\nold nests in mid-winter. Now and again, it is true, a case of actually\nnesting at that season has been noticed, but the fancy for sporting\nround the deserted nests is something quite different from this. I have\nwatched the birds at the nests on short winter days year after year, but\nnever yet saw any confirmation of the widely accepted view that their\nobject is the putting in order of their battered homes for the next\nseason. It seems a likely reason, but in that case the birds would\nsurely be seen carrying twigs for the purpose, and I never saw them do\nso before January. What other attraction the empty nurseries can have\nfor them is a mystery, unless indeed they are sentimental enough to like\nrevisiting old scenes and cawing over old memories.\n\nThe proximity of a rookery does not affect all people alike. Some who,\nordinarily dwelling in cities, suffer from lack of bird neighbours,\nwould regard the deliberate destruction of a rookery as an act of\nvandalism. A few, as a matter of fact, actually set about establishing\nsuch a colony where none previously existed, an ambition that may\ngenerally be accomplished without extreme difficulty. All that is needed\nis to transplant a nest or two of young rooks and lodge them in suitable\ntrees. The parent birds usually follow, rear the broods, and forthwith\nfound a settlement for future generations to return to. Even artificial\nnests, with suitable supplies of food, have succeeded, and it seems that\nthe rook is nowhere a very difficult neighbour to attract and establish.\n\nWhy are rooks more sociable than ravens, and what do they gain from such\ncommunalism? These are favourite questions with persons informed with an\nintelligent passion for acquiring information, and the best answer,\nwithout any thought of irreverence, is "God knows!" It is most certain\nthat we, at any rate, do not. So far from explaining how it was that\nrooks came to build their nests in company, we cannot even guess how the\nmajority of birds came to build nests at all, instead of remaining\nsatisfied with the simpler plan of laying their eggs in the ground that\nis still good enough for the petrels, penguins, kingfishers, and many\nother kinds. Protection of the eggs from rain, frost, and natural\nenemies suggests itself as the object of the nest, but the last only\nwould to some extent be furthered by the gregarious habit, and even so\nwe have no clue as to why it should be any more necessary for rooks than\nfor crows. To quote, as some writers do, the numerical superiority of\nrooks over ravens as evidence of the benefits of communal nesting is to\nignore the long hostility of shepherds towards the latter birds on which\ncenturies of persecution have told irreparably. Rooks, on the other\nhand, though also regarded in some parts of these islands as suspects,\nhave never been harassed to the same extent; and if anything in the\nnature of general warfare were to be inaugurated against them, the\ngregarious habit, so far from being a protection, would speedily and\ndisastrously facilitate their extermination. Another curious habit\nnoticed in these birds is that of flying on fine evenings to a\nconsiderable height and then swooping suddenly to earth, often on their\nbacks. These antics, comparable to the drumming of snipe and roding of\nwoodcock, are probably to be explained on the same basis of sexual\nemotion.\n\nThe so-called parliament of the rooks probably owes much of its detail\nto the florid imagination of enthusiasts, always ready to exaggerate the\nwonders of Nature; but it also seems to have some existence in fact, and\nprivileged observers have actually described the trial and punishment of\nindividuals that have broken the laws of the commune. I never saw this\nprocedure among rooks, but once watched something very similar among the\nfamous dogs of Constantinople, which no longer exist.\n\nThe most important problem however in connection with the rook is the\nprecise extent to which the bird is the farmer\'s enemy or his friend. On\nthe solution hangs the rook\'s fate in an increasingly practical age,\nwhich may at any moment put sentiment on one side and decree for it the\nfate that is already overtaking its big cousin the raven. Scotch farmers\nhave long turned their thumbs down and regarded rooks as food for the\ngun, but in South Britain the bird\'s apologists have hitherto been able\nto hold their own and avert catastrophe from their favourite. The\nevidence is conflicting. On the one hand, it seems undeniable that the\nrook eats grain and potato shoots. It also snaps young twigs off the\ntrees and may, like the jay and magpie, destroy the eggs of game birds.\nOn the other hand, particularly during the weeks when it is feeding its\nnestlings, it admittedly devours quantities of wireworms, leathergrubs,\nand weevils, as well as of couch grass and other noxious weeds, while\nsome of its favourite dainties, such as thistles, walnuts, and acorns,\nwill hardly be grudged at any time. It is not an easy matter to decide;\nand, if the rook is to be spared, economy must be tempered with\nsentiment, in which case the evidence will perhaps be found to justify a\nverdict of guilty, with a strong recommendation to mercy.\n\n\n\n\nMAY\n\nTHE CUCKOO\n\n\n\n\nTHE CUCKOO\n\n\nWith the single exception of the nightingale, bird of lovers, no other\nhas been more written of in prose or verse than the so-called "harbinger\nof spring." This is a foolish name for a visitor that does not reach our\nshores before, at any rate, the middle of April. Even _Whitaker_ allows\nus to recognise the coming of spring nearly a month earlier; and for\nmyself, impatient if only for the illusion of Nature\'s awakening, I date\nmy spring from the ending of the shortest day. Once the days begin to\nlengthen, it is time to glance at the elms for the return of the rooks\nand to get out one\'s fishing-tackle again. Yet the cuckoo comes rarely\nbefore the third week of April, save in the fervent imagination of\npremature heralds, who, giving rein to a fancy winged by desire, or\nhonestly deceived by some village cuckoo clock heard on their country\nrambles, solemnly write to the papers announcing the inevitable March\ncuckoo. They know better in the Channel Islands, for in the second week\nof April, and not before, there are cuckoos in every bush--hundreds of\nexhausted travellers pausing for strength to complete the rest of their\njourney to Britain. Not on the return migration in August do the\nwanderers assemble in the islands, since, having but lately set out,\nthey are not yet weary enough to need the rest. The only district of\nEngland in which I have heard of similar gatherings of cuckoos is East\nAnglia, where, about the time of their arrival, they regularly collect\nin the bushes and indulge in preliminary gambols before flying north and\nwest.\n\nCuckoos, then, reach these islands about the third week of April, and\nthey leave us again at the end of the summer, the old birds flying south\nin July, the younger generation following three or four weeks later.\nGoodness knows by what extraordinary instinct these young ones know the\nway. But the young cuckoo is a marvel altogether in the manner of its\neducation, since, when one comes to think of it, it has no upbringing by\nits own parents and cannot even learn how to cry "Cuckoo!" by example or\ninstruction. Its foster-parents speak another language, and its own\nfolk have ceased from singing by the time it is out of the nest. A good\ndeal has been written about the way in which the note varies, chiefly in\nthe direction of greater harshness and a more staccato and less\nsustained note, towards the end of the cuckoo\'s stay. According to the\nrustic rhyme, it changes its tune in June, which is probably poetic\nlicence rather than the fruits of actual observation. It is, however,\ncommonly agreed that the cuckoo is less often heard as the time of its\ndeparture draws near, and the easiest explanation of its silence, once\nthe breeding season is ended, is that the note, being the love-call of a\npolygamous bird, is no longer needed.\n\nIn Australia the female cuckoo is handsomely barred with white, whereas\nthe male is uniformly black; but with our bird it is exceedingly\ndifficult to distinguish one sex from the other on the wing, and, were\nit not for occasional evidence of females having been shot when actually\ncalling, we might still believe that it is the male only that makes this\nsound. The note is joyous only in the poet\'s fancy, just as he has also\nread sadness into the "sobbing" of the nightingale. There is, indeed,\nwhen we consider its life, something fantastic in the hypothesis that\nthe cuckoo can know no trouble in life, merely because it escapes the\nrigours of our winter. Eternal summer must be a delight, but the cuckoo\nhas to work hard for the privilege, and it must at times be harried to\nthe verge of desperation by the small birds that continually mob it in\nbroad daylight. This behaviour on the part of its pertinacious little\nneighbours has been the occasion of much futile speculation; but the one\ncertain result of such persecution is to make the cuckoo, along with its\nfellow-sufferer, the owls, preferably active in the sweet peace of the\ngloaming, when its puny tyrants are gone to roost. Much heated argument\nhas raged round the real or supposed sentiment that inspires such\ndemonstrations on the part of linnets, sparrows, chaffinches, and other\ndetermined hunters of the cuckoo. It seems impossible, when we observe\nthe larger bird\'s unmistakable desire to win free of them, to attribute\nfriendly feelings to its pursuers. Yet some writers have held the\ncurious belief that, with lingering memories of the days when, a year\nago, they devoted themselves to the ugly foster-child, the little birds\nstill regard the stranger with affection. If so, then they have an\neccentric way of showing it, and the cuckoo, driven by the chattering\nlittle termagants from pillar to post, may well pray to be saved from\nits friends. On the other hand, even though convinced of their\nhostility, it is not easy to believe, as some folks tell us, that they\nmistake the cuckoo for a hawk. Even the human eye, though slower to take\nnote of such differences, can distinguish between the two, and the\ncuckoo\'s note would still further undeceive them. The most satisfactory\nexplanation of all perhaps is that the nest memories do in truth\nsurvive, not, however, investing the cuckoo with a halo of romance, but\nrather branding it as an object of suspicion, an interloper, to be\ndriven out of the neighbourhood at all costs ere it has time to billet\nits offspring on the hard-working residents. All of which is, needless\nto say, the merest guesswork, since any attempt to interpret the\nsimplest actions of birds is likely to lead us into erroneous\nconclusions. Yet, of the two, it certainly seems more reasonable to\nregard the smaller birds as resenting the parasitic habit in the cuckoo\nthan to admit that they can actually welcome the murder of their own\noffspring to make room in the nest for the ugly changeling foisted on\nthem by this fly-by-night.\n\nOn the _lucus a non lucendo_ principle, the cuckoo is chiefly\ninteresting as a parent. The bare fact is that our British kind builds\nno nest of its own, but puts its eggs out to hatch, choosing for the\npurpose the nests of numerous small birds which it knows to be suitable.\nFurther investigation of the habits of this not very secretive bird,\nshows that she first lays her egg on the ground and then carries it in\nher bill to a neighbouring nest. Whether she first chooses the nest and\nthen lays the egg destined to be hatched in it, or whether she lays each\negg when so moved and then hunts about for a home for it, has never been\nascertained. The former method seems the more practical of the two. On\nthe other hand, little nests of the right sort are so plentiful in May\nthat, with her mother-instinct to guide her, she could always find one\nat a few moments\' notice. Some people, who are never so happy as when\nmaking the wonders of Nature seem still more wonderful than they really\nare, have declared that the cuckoo lays eggs to match those among which\nshe deposits them, or that, at any rate, she chooses the nests of birds\nwhose eggs approximately resemble her own. I should have liked to\nbelieve this, but am unfortunately debarred by the memory of about forty\ncuckoo\'s eggs that I took, seven-and-twenty summers ago, in the woods\nround Dartford Heath. The majority of these were found in hedgesparrows\'\nnests, and the absolute dissimilarity between the great spotted egg of\nthe cuckoo and the little blue egg of its so-called dupe would have\nimpressed even a colour-blind animal. Occasionally, I believe, a blue\ncuckoo\'s egg has been found, but such a freak could hardly be the result\nof design. As a matter of fact, there is no need for any such elaborate\ndeception. Up to the moment of hatching, the little foster-parents have\nin all probability no suspicion of the trick that has been played on\nthem. Birds do not take deliberate notice of the size or colour of\ntheir own eggs. Kearton somewhere relates how he once induced a\nblackbird to sit on the eggs of a thrush, and a lapwing on those of a\nredshank. So, too, farmyard hens will hatch the eggs of ducks or game\nbirds and wild birds can even be persuaded to sit on eggs made of\npainted wood. Why then, since they are so careless of appearances,\nshould the cuckoo go to all manner of trouble to match the eggs of\nhedgesparrow, robin or warbler? The bird would not notice the\ndifference, and, even if she did, she would probably sit quite as close,\nif only for the sake of the other eggs of her own laying. Once the ugly\nnestling is hatched, there comes swift awakening. Yet there is no\nthought of reprisal or desertion. It looks rather as if the little\nfoster-parents are hypnotised by the uncouth guest, for they see their\nown young ones elbowed out of the home and continue, with unflagging\ndevotion, to minister to the insatiable appetite of the greedy little\nmurderer. A bird so imbued as the parasitic cuckoo with the _Wanderlust_\nwould make a very careless parent, and we must therefore perhaps revise\nour unflattering estimate of its attitude and admit that it does the\nbest it can by its offspring in putting them out to nurse. This habit,\nunique among British birds, is practised by many others elsewhere, and\nin particular by the American troupials, or cattle-starlings. One of\nthese indeed goes even farther, since it entrusts its eggs to the care\nof a nest-building cousin. There are also American cuckoos that build\ntheir own nest and incubate their own eggs.\n\nOn the whole, our cuckoo is a friend to the farmer, for it destroys vast\nquantities of hairy caterpillars that no other bird, resident or\nmigratory, would touch. On the other hand, no doubt, the numbers of\nother small useful birds must suffer, not alone because the cuckoo sucks\ntheir eggs, but also because, as has been shown, the rearing of every\nyoung cuckoo means the destruction of the legitimate occupants of the\nnest. So far however as the farmer is concerned, this is probably\nbalanced by the reflection that a single young cuckoo is so rapacious as\nto need all the insect food available.\n\nThe cuckoo, like the woodcock, is supposed to have its forerunner. Just\nas the small horned owl, which reaches our shores a little in advance\nof the latter, is popularly known as the "woodcock owl," so also the\nwryneck, which comes to us about the same time as the first of the\ncuckoos, goes by the name of "cuckoo-leader." It is never a very\nconspicuous bird, and appears to be rarer nowadays than formerly.\nSchoolboys know it best from its habit of hissing like a snake and\ngiving them a rare fright when they cautiously insert a predatory hand\nin some hollow tree in search of a possible nest. It is in such\nsituations that, along with titmice and some other birds, the wryneck\nrears its young; and it doubtless owes many an escape to this habit of\nhissing, accompanied by a vigorous twisting of its neck and the\ninfliction of a sufficient peck, easily mistaken in a moment of panic\nfor the bite of an angry adder. Thus does Nature protect her weaklings.\n\n\n\n\nJUNE\n\nVOICES OF THE NIGHT\n\n\n\n\nVOICES OF THE NIGHT\n\n\nThe majority of nocturnal animals, more particularly those bent on\nspoliation, are strangely silent. True, frogs croak in the marshes, bats\nshrill overhead at so high a pitch that some folks cannot hear them, and\nowls hoot from their ruins in a fashion that some vote melodious and\nromantic, while others associate the sound rather with midnight crime\nand dislike it accordingly. The badger, on the other hand, with the\notter and fox--all of them sad thieves from our point of view--have\nlearnt, whatever their primeval habits, to go about their marauding in\nstealthy silence; and it is only in less settled regions that one hears\nthe jackals barking, the hyænas howling, and the browsing deer whistling\nthrough the night watches.\n\nThere are, however, two of our native birds, or rather summer visitors,\nsince they leave us in autumn, closely associated with these warm June\nnights, the stillness of which they break in very different fashion, and\nthese are the nightingale and nightjar. Each is of considerable\ninterest in its own way. It is not to be denied that the churring note\nof the nightjar is, to ordinary ears, the reverse of attractive, and the\nbird is not much more pleasing to the eye than to the ear; while the\nnightingale, on the contrary, produces such sweet sounds as made Izaak\nWalton marvel what music God could provide for His saints in heaven when\nHe gave such as this to sinners on earth. The suggestion was not wholly\nhis own, since the father of angling borrowed it from a French writer;\nbut he vastly improved on the original, and the passage will long live\nin the hearts of thousands who care not a jot for his instructions in\nrespect of worms. At the same time, the nightjar, though the less\nattractive bird of the two, is fully as interesting as its comrade of\nthe summer darkness, and there should be no difficulty in indicating the\nlittle that they have in common, as well as much wherein they differ, in\nboth habits and appearance.\n\nBoth, then, are birds of sober attire. Indeed of the two, the nightjar,\nwith its soft and delicately pencilled plumage and the conspicuous white\nspots, is perhaps the handsomer, though, as it is seen only in the\ngloaming, its quiet beauty is but little appreciated. The unobtrusive\ndress of the nightingale, on the other hand, is familiar in districts in\nwhich the bird abounds, and is commonly quoted, by contrast with its\nunrivalled voice, as the converse of the gaudy colouring of raucous\nmacaws and parrakeets. As has been said, both these birds are summer\nmigrants, the nightingale arriving on our shores about the middle of\nApril, the nightjar perhaps a fortnight later. Thenceforth, however,\ntheir programmes are wholly divergent, for, whereas the nightjars\nproceed to scatter over the length and breadth of Britain, penetrating\neven to Ireland in the west and as far north as the Hebrides, the\nnightingale stops far short of these extremes and leaves whole counties\nof England, as well as probably the whole of Scotland, and certainly the\nwhole of Ireland, out of its calculations. It is however well known that\nits range is slowly but surely extending towards the west.\n\nThis curiously restricted distribution of the nightingale, indeed,\nwithin the limits of its summer home is among the most remarkable of\nthe many problems confronting the student of distribution, and\nsuccessive ingenious but unconvincing attempts to explain its seeming\neccentricity, or at any rate caprice, in the choice of its nesting range\nonly make the confusion worse. Briefly, in spite of a number of doubtful\nand even suspicious reports of the bird\'s occurrence outside of these\nboundaries, it is generally agreed by the soundest observers that its\ntravels do not extend much north of the city of York, or much west of a\nline drawn through Exeter and Birmingham. By way of complicating the\nargument, we know, on good authority, that the nightingale\'s range is\nequally peculiar elsewhere; and that, whereas it likewise shuns the\ndepartments in the extreme west of France, it occurs all over the\nPeninsula, a region extending considerably farther into the sunset than\neither Brittany or Cornwall, in both of which it is unknown. No\nsatisfactory explanation of the little visitor\'s objection to Wild Wales\nor Cornwall has been found, and it may at once be stated that its\ncapricious distribution cannot be accounted for by any known facts of\nsoil, climate, or vegetation, since the surroundings which it finds\nsuitable in Kent and Sussex are equally to be found down in the West\nCountry, but fail to attract their share of nightingales.\n\nThe song of the nightingale, in praise of which volumes have been\nwritten, is perhaps more beautiful than that of any other bird, though I\nhave heard wonderful efforts from the mocking-bird in the United States\nand from the bulbuls along the banks of the Jordan. The latter are\nsometimes, more especially in poetry, regarded as identical with the\nnightingale; and, indeed, some ornithologists hold the two to be closely\nrelated. What a gap there is between the sobbing cadences of the\nnightingale and the rasping note of the nightjar, which, with specific\nreference to a Colonial cousin of that bird Tasmanians ingeniously\nrender as "more pork"! It seems almost ludicrous to include under the\nhead of birdsong not only the music of the nightingale, but also the\ncroak of the raven and the booming note of the ostrich. Yet these also\nare the love-songs of their kind, and the hen ostrich doubtless finds\nmore music in the thunderous note of her lord than in the faint melody\nof such song-birds as her native Africa provides. The nightingale sings\nto his mate while she is sitting on her olive-green eggs perching on a\nlow branch of the tree, at foot of which the slender nest is hidden in\nthe undergrowth. So much is known to every schoolboy who is too often\nguided by the sound on his errand of plunder; and why the song of this\nparticular warbler should have been described by so many writers as one\nof sadness, seeing that it is associated with the most joyous days in\nthe bird\'s year, passes comprehension. So obviously is its object to\nhearten the female in her long and patient vigil that as soon as the\nyoung are hatched the male\'s voice breaks like that of other choristers\nto a guttural croak. It is said, indeed--though so cruel an experiment\nwould not appeal to many--that if the nest be destroyed just as the\nyoung are hatched the bird recovers all his sweetness of voice and sings\nanew while another home is built.\n\nAlthough poetic licence has ascribed the song to the female, it is the\nmale nightingale only that sings, and for the purpose aforementioned.\nThe note of the nightjar, on the other hand, is equally uttered by both\nsexes, and both also have the curious habit of repeatedly clapping the\nwings for several minutes together. They moreover share the business of\nincubation, taking day and night duty on the eggs, which, two in number,\nare laid on the bare ground without any pretence of a nest, and\ngenerally on open commons in the neighbourhood of patches of fern-brake.\nLike the owls, these birds sleep during the day and are active only when\nthe sun goes down. It is this habit of seeking their insect food only in\nthe gloaming which makes nightjars among the most difficult of birds to\nstudy from life, and all accounts of their feeding habits must therefore\nbe received with caution, particularly that which compares the bristles\non the mouth with baleen in whales, serving as a sort of strainer for\nthe capture of minute flying prey. This is an interesting suggestion,\nand may even be sober fact; but its adoption would necessitate the bird\nflying open-mouthed among the oaks and other trees beneath which it\nfinds the yellow underwings and cockchafers on which it feeds, and I\nhave more than once watched it hunting its victims with the beak closed.\nI noticed this particularly when camping in the backwoods of Eastern\nCanada where the bird goes by the name of nighthawk.\n\nIn all probability its food consists exclusively of insects, though\nexceptional cases have been noted in which the young birds had evidently\nbeen fed on seeds. The popular error which charges it with stealing the\nmilk of ewes and goats, from which it derives the undeserved name of\n"goat-sucker," with its equivalent in several Continental languages, is\nanother result of the imperfect light in which it is commonly observed.\nNeedless to say, there is no truth whatever in the accusation, for the\nnightjar would find no more pleasure in drinking milk than we should in\neating moths.\n\nHere, then, are two night-voices of very different calibre. These are\nnot our only birds that break the silence on moonlight nights in June.\nThe common thrush often sings far into the night, and the sedge-warbler\nis a persistent caroller that has often been mistaken for the\nnightingale. The difference in this respect between the two subjects of\nthese remarks is that the nightjar is invariably silent all through the\nday, whereas the nightingale sings joyously at all hours. It is only\nbecause his splendid music is more marked in the comparative silence of\nthe night, with little or no competition, that his daylight concert is\noften overlooked.\n\n\n\n\nJULY\n\nSWIFTS, SWALLOWS AND MARTINS\n\n\n\n\nSWIFTS, SWALLOWS AND MARTINS\n\n\nWhen the trout-fisherman sees the first martins and swallows dipping\nover the sward of the water-meadows and skimming the surface of the\nstream in hot pursuit of such harried water-insects as have escaped the\njaws of greedy fish, he knows that summer is coming in. The signs of\nspring have been evident in the budding hedgerows for some weeks. The\nrooks are cawing in the elms, the cuckoo\'s note has been heard in the\nspinney for some time before these little visitors pass in jerky flight\nup and down the valley. Then, a little later, come the swifts--the black\nand screaming swifts--which, though learned folk may be right in\nsundering them utterly from their smaller travelling companions from the\nsunny south, will always in the popular fancy be associated with the\nrest. Colonies of swifts, swallows, and martins are a dominant feature\nof English village life during the warm months; and though there are\nfastidious folk who take not wholly culpable exception to their little\nvisitors on the score of cleanliness, most of us welcome them back each\nyear, if only for the sake of the glad season of their stay. If,\nmoreover, it is a question of choice between these untiring travellers\nresting in our eaves and the stay-at-home starling or sparrow, the\nchoice will surely fall on the first every time.\n\nThe swift is the largest and most rapid in its flight, and its voice has\na penetrating quality lacking in the notes of the rest. Swifts screaming\nin headlong flight about a belfry or up and down a country lane are the\nembodiment of that sheer joy of life which, in some cases with slender\nreason, we associate peculiarly with the bird-world. Probably, however,\nthese summer migrants are as happy as most of their class. On the wing\nthey can have few natural enemies, though one may now and again be\nstruck down by a hawk; and they alight on the ground so rarely as to run\nlittle risk from cats or weasels, while the structure and position of\ntheir nests alike afford effectual protection for the eggs and young.\nCompared with that of the majority of small birds, therefore, their\nexistence should be singularly happy and free from care; and though\nthat of the swift can scarcely, perhaps, when we remember its shrill\nvoice, be described as one grand sweet song, it should not be chequered\nby many troubles. The greatest risk is no doubt that of being snapped up\nby some watchful pike if the bird skims too close to the surface of\neither still or running water, and I have even heard of their being\nseized in this way by hungry mahseer, those great barbel which gladden\nthe heart of exiled anglers whose lot is cast on the banks of Himalayan\nrivers.\n\nIt is, however, the sparrows and starlings, rivals for the nesting\nsites, who show themselves the irreconcilable enemies of the returned\nprodigals. Terrific battles are continually enacted between them with\nvarying fortunes, and the anecdotes of these frays would fill a volume.\nJesse tells of a feud at Hampton Court, in the course of which the\nswallows, having only then completed their nest, were evicted by\nsparrows, who forthwith took possession and hatched out their eggs. Then\ncame Nemesis, for the sparrows were compelled to go foraging for food\nwith which to fill the greedy beaks, and during their enforced absence\nthe swallows returned in force, threw the nestlings out, and demolished\nthe home. The sparrows sought other quarters, and the swallows\ntriumphantly built a new nest on the ruins of the old. A German writer\nrelates a case of revolting reprisal on the part of some swallows\nagainst a sparrow that appropriated their nest and refused to quit.\nAfter repeated failure to evict the intruder, the swallows, helped by\nother members of the colony, calmly plastered up the front door so\neffectually that the unfortunate sparrow was walled up alive and died of\nhunger. This refined mode of torture is not unknown in the history of\nmankind, but seems singularly unsuited to creatures so fragile.\n\nThe nests of these birds show, as a rule, little departure from the\nconventional plan, but they do adapt their architecture to\ncircumstances, and I remember being much struck on one occasion by the\nabsence of any dome or roof. It was in Asia Minor, on the seashore, that\nI came upon a cottage long deserted, its door hanging by one hinge, and\nall the glass gone from the windows. In the empty rooms numerous\nswallows were rearing twittering broods in roofless nests. No doubt the\nbirds realised that they had nothing to fear from rain, and were\nreluctant to waste time and labour in covering their homes with\nunnecessary roofs.\n\nMost birds are careful in the education of their young, and indeed\nthorough training at an early stage must be essential in the case of\ncreatures that are left to protect themselves and to find their own food\nwhen only a few weeks old. Fortunately they develop with a rapidity that\nputs man and other mammals to shame, and the helpless bald little swift\nlying agape in the nest will in another fortnight be able to fly across\nEurope. One of the most favoured observers of the early teaching given\nby the mother-swallow to her brood was an angler who told me how, one\nevening when he was fishing in some ponds at no great distance from\nLondon, a number of baby swallows alighted on his rod. He kept as still\nas possible, fearful of alarming his interesting visitors, but he must\nat last have moved, for, with one accord, they all fell off his rod\ntogether, skimmed over the surface of the water and disappeared in the\ndirection from which they had come a few moments earlier.\n\nSwifts fly to an immense height these July evenings, mounting to such an\naltitude as eventually to disappear out of sight altogether. This\ncurious habit, which is but imperfectly understood, has led to the\nbelief that, instead of roosting in the nest or among the reeds like the\nswallows, the males, at any rate, spend the night flying about under the\nstars. This fantastic notion is not, however, likely to commend itself\nto those who pause to reflect on the incessant activity displayed by\nthese birds the livelong day. So rarely indeed do they alight that\ncountry folk gravely deny them the possession of feet, and it is in the\nlast degree improbable that a bird of such feverish alertness could\ndispense with its night\'s rest. No one who has watched swifts, swallows\nand martins on the wing can fail to be struck by the extraordinary\njudgment with which these untiring birds seem to shave the arches of\nbridges, gateposts, and other obstacles in the way of their flight by so\nnarrow a margin as continually to give the impression of catastrophe\nimminent and inevitable. Their escapes from collision are marvellous;\nbut the birds are not infallible, as is shown by the untoward fate of a\nswallow in Sussex. In an old garden in that county there had for many\nyears been an open doorway with no door, and through the open space the\nswallows had been wont, year after year, to fly to and fro on their\nhunting trips. Then came a fateful winter during which a new owner took\nit into his head to put up a fresh gate and to keep it locked, and, as\nill luck would have it, he painted it blue, which, in the season of fine\nweather, probably heightened the illusion. Back came the happy swallows\nto their old playground, and one of the pioneers flew headlong at the\nclosed gate and fell stunned and dying on the ground, a minor tragedy\nthat may possibly come as a surprise to those who regard the instincts\nof wild birds as unerring.\n\nThat the young swallows leave our shores before their elders--late in\nAugust or early in September--is an established fact, and the instinct\nwhich guides them aright over land and sea, without assistance from\nthose more experienced, is nothing short of amazing. The swifts, last\nto come, are also first to go, spending less time in the land of their\nbirth than either swallows or martins. The fact that an occasional\nswallow has been seen in this country during the winter months finds\nexpression in the adage that "one swallow does not make a summer," and\nit was no doubt this occasional apparition that in a less enlightened\nage seemed to warrant the extraordinary belief, which still ekes out a\nprecarious existence in misinformed circles, that these birds, instead\nof wintering abroad, retire in a torpid condition to the bottom of lakes\nand ponds. It cannot be denied that these waters have occasionally, when\ndredged or drained, yielded a stray skeleton of a swallow, but it should\nbe evident to the most homely intelligence that such débris merely\nindicates careless individuals that, in passing over the water, got\ntheir plumage waterlogged and were then drowned. It seems strange that\nGilbert White, so accurate an observer of birds, should actually have\ntoyed with this curious belief, though he leant rather to the more\nreasonable version of occasional hybernation in caves or other\nsheltered hiding-places. The rustic mind, however, preferred, and in\nsome unsophisticated districts still prefers, the ancient belief in\ndiving swallows, and no weight of evidence, however carefully presented,\nwould shake it in its creed. Fortunately this eccentric view of the\nswallow\'s habits brings no harm to the bird itself, and may thus be\ntolerated as an innocuous indulgence on the part of those who prefer\nthis fiction to the even stranger truth.\n\n\n\n\nAUGUST\n\nTHE SEAGULL\n\n\n\n\nTHE SEAGULL\n\n\nSo glorious is the flight of the seagull that it tempts us to fling\naside the dry-as-dust theories of mechanism of flexed wings, coefficient\nof air resistance, and all the abracadabra of the mathematical\nbiologist, and just to give thanks for a sight so inspiring as that of\ngulls ringing high in the eye of the wind over hissing combers that\nbreak on sloping beaches or around jagged rocks. These birds are one\nwith the sea, knowing no fear of that protean monster which, since\nearth\'s beginning, has always, with its unfathomable mystery, its\ninsatiable cruelty, its tremendous strength, been a source of terror to\nthe land animals that dwell in sight of it. Yet the gulls sit on the\ncurling rollers as much at their ease as swimmers in a pond, and give an\nimpression of unconscious courage very remarkable in creatures that seem\nso frail. Hunger may drive them inland, or instincts equally\nirresistible at the breeding season, but never the worst gale that\nlashes the sea to fury, for they dread it in its hour of rage as little\nas on still summer nights when, in their hundreds, they fly off the land\nto roost on the water outside the headlands.\n\nIt is curious that there should be no mention of them in the sacred\nwritings. We read of quails coming in from the sea, likewise of "four\ngreat beasts," but of seafowl never a word, though one sees them in\nabundance on the coast near Jaffa, and the Hebrew writers might have\nbeen expected to weave them into the rich fabrics of their poetic\nimagery as they did the pelican, the eagle and other birds less\nfamiliar. Although seagulls have of late years been increasingly in\nevidence beside the bridges of London, they are still, to the majority\nof folk living far inland, symbolical of the August holiday at the\ncoast, and their splendid flight and raucous cries are among the most\nenduring memories of that yearly escape from the smoke of cities.\n\nThe voice of gulls can with difficulty be regarded as musical, yet those\nof us who live the year round by the sea find their plaintive mewing as\nnicely tuned to that wild environment as the amorous gurgling of\nnightingales to moonlit woods in May. Their voice may have no great\nrange, but at any rate it is not lacking in variety, suggesting to the\nplayful imagination laughter, tears, and other human moods to which they\nare in all probability strangers. The curious similarity between the\nnote of a seagull and the whining of a cat bereft of her kittens is very\nstriking, and was on one occasion the cause of my being taken in by one\nof these birds in a deep and beautiful backwater of the Sea of Marmora,\nbeside which I spent one pleasant summer. In this particular gulf, at\nthe head of which stands the ancient town of Ismidt, gulls, though\nplentiful in the open sea, are rarely in evidence, being replaced by\nherons and pelicans. I had not therefore set eyes on a seagull for many\nweeks, when early one morning I heard, from the farther side of a wooded\nheadland, a new note suggestive of a wild cat or possibly a lynx. My\nGreek servant tried in his patois to explain the unseen owner of the\nmysterious voice, but it was only when a small gull suddenly came\npaddling round the corner that I realised my mistake.\n\nIn addition to being at home on the seashore, and particularly in\nestuaries and where the coast is rocky, gulls are a familiar sight in\nthe wake of steamers at the beginning and ending of the voyage, as well\nas following the plough and nesting in the vicinity of inland meres and\nmarshes. The black-headed kind is peculiarly given to bringing up its\nfamily far from the sea, just as the salmon ascends our rivers for the\nsame purpose. It is not perhaps a very loving parent, seeing that the\nmortality among young gulls, many of which show signs of rough treatment\nby their elders, is unusually great. On most lakes rich in fish these\nbirds have long established themselves, and they were, I remember, as\nfamiliar at Geneva and Neuchâtel as along the shores of Lake Tahoe in\nthe Californian Sierras, itself two hundred miles from the Pacific and\nmore than a mile above sea-level. Gulls also follow the plough in\nhordes, not always to the complete satisfaction of the farmer, who is,\nnot unreasonably, sceptical when told that they seek wireworms only and\nhave no taste for grain. Unfortunately the ordinary scarecrow has no\nterror for them, and I recollect, in the neighbourhood of Maryport,\nseeing an immense number of gulls turning up the soil in close proximity\nto several crows that, dangling from gibbets, effectually kept all black\nmarauders away.\n\nYoung gulls are, to the careless eye, apt to look larger than their\nparents, an illusion possibly due to the optical effect of their dappled\nplumage, and few people unfamiliar with these birds in their succeeding\nmoults readily believe that the dark birds are younger than the white.\nDown in little Cornish harbours I have sometimes watched these young\nbirds turned to good account by their lazy elders, who call them to the\nfeast whenever the ebbing tide uncovers a heap of dead pilchards lying\nin three or four feet of water, and then pounce on them the moment they\ncome to the surface with their booty. The fact is that gulls are not\nexpert divers. The cormorant and puffin and guillemot can vanish at the\nflash of a gun, reappearing far from where they were last seen, and can\npursue and catch some of the swiftest fishes under water. Some gulls,\nhowever, are able to plunge farther below the surface than others, and\nthe little kittiwake is perhaps the most expert diver of them all,\nthough in no sense at home under water like the shag. I have often, when\nat anchor ten or fifteen miles from the land, and attended by the usual\nconvoy of seabirds that invariably gather round fishing-boats, amused\nmyself by throwing scraps of fish to them and watching the gulls do\ntheir best to plunge below the surface when some coveted morsel was\ngoing down into the depths, and now and again a little Roman-nose puffin\nwould dive headlong and snatch the prize from under the gulls\' eyes.\nMost of the birds were fearless enough; only an occasional\n"saddleback"--the greater black-backed gull of the text-books--knowing\nthe hand of man to be against it for its raids on game and poultry,\nwould keep at a respectful distance.\n\nConsidered economically, the smaller gulls at any rate have more friends\nthan enemies, and they owe most of the latter not so much to their\nappetites, which set more store by offal and carrion than by anything of\ngreater value, as to their exceedingly dirty habits. These unclean fowl\nare in fact anything but welcome in harbours given over in summer to\nsmart yachting craft; and I remember how at Avalon, the port of Santa\nCatalina Island (Cal.), various devices were employed to prevent them\nalighting. Boats at their moorings were festooned with strips of\nbunting, which apparently had the requisite effect, and the railings of\nthe club were protected by a formidable armour of nails. On the credit\nside of their account with ourselves, seagulls are admittedly assiduous\nscavengers, and their services in keeping little tidal harbours clear of\ndecaying fish which, if left to accumulate, would speedily breed a\npestilence, cannot well be overrated. The fishermen, though they rarely\nmolest them, do not always refer to the birds with the gratitude that\nmight be expected, yet they are still further in their debt, being often\napprised by their movement of the whereabouts of mackerel and pilchard\nshoals, and, in thick weather, getting many a friendly warning of the\nwhereabouts of outlying rocks from the hoarse cries of the gulls that\nhave their haunts on these menaces to inshore navigation.\n\nSeagulls are not commonly made pets of, the nearest approach to such\nadoption being an occasional pinioned individual enjoying qualified\nliberty in a backyard. Their want of popularity is easily understood,\nsince they lack the music of the canary and the mimicry of parrots. That\nthey are, however, capable of appreciating kindness has been\ndemonstrated by many anecdotes. The Rev. H. A. Macpherson used to tell a\nstory of how a young gull, found with a broken wing by the children of\nsome Milovaig crofters, was nursed back to health by them until it\neventually flew away. Not long after it had gone, one of the children\nwas lost on the hillside, and the gull, flying overhead, recognised one\nof its old playmates and hovered so as to attract the attention of the\nchild. Then, on being called, the bird settled and roosted on the ground\nbeside him. An even more remarkable story is told of a gull taken from\nthe nest, on the coast of county Cork, and brought up by hand until, in\nthe following spring, it flew away in the company of some others of its\nkind that passed over the garden in which it had its liberty. The bird\'s\nowner reasonably concluded that he had seen the last of his protégée,\nand great was his astonishment when, in the first October gale, not\nonly did the visitor return, tapping at the dining-room window for\nadmission, as it had always done, but actually brought with it a young\ngull, and the two paid him a visit every autumn for a number of years.\n\nOn either side of the gulls, and closely associated with them in habits\nand in structure, is a group of birds equally characteristic of the open\ncoast, the skuas and terns. The skuas, darker and more courageous birds,\nare familiar to those who spend their August holiday sea-fishing near\nthe Land\'s End, where, particularly on days when the east wind brings\nthe gannets and porpoises close inshore, the great skua may be seen at\nits favourite game of swooping on the gulls and making them disgorge or\ndrop their launce or pilchard, which the bird usually retrieves before\nit reaches the water. This act of piracy has earned for the skua its\nWest Country sobriquet of "Jack Harry," and against so fierce an\nonslaught even the largest gull, though actually of heavier build than\nits tyrant, has no chance and seldom indeed seems to offer the feeblest\nresistance. These skuas rob their neighbours in every latitude; and\neven in the Antarctic one kind, closely related to our own, makes havoc\namong the penguins, an episode described by the late Dr. Wilson, one of\nthe heroes of the ill-fated Scott expedition.\n\nFar more pleasing to the eye are the graceful little terns, or\n"sea-swallows," fairylike creatures with red legs and bill, long pointed\nwings and deeply forked tail, which skim the surface of the sea or hawk\nover the shallows of trout streams in search of dragonflies or small\nfish. It is not a very rare experience for the trout-fisherman to hook a\nswallow which may happen to dash by at the moment of casting; but a much\nmore unusual occurrence was that of a tern, on a well-known pool of the\nSpey, actually mistaking a salmon-fly for a small fish and swooping on\nit, only to get firmly hooked by the bill. Fortunately for the too\nventuresome tern the fisherman was a lover of birds, and he managed with\nsome difficulty to reel it in gently, after which it was released none\nthe worse for its mistake.\n\n\n\n\nSEPTEMBER\n\nBIRDS IN THE CORN\n\n\n\n\nBIRDS IN THE CORN\n\n\nMore than one of our summer visitors, like the nightingale and cuckoo,\nare less often seen than heard, but certainly the most secretive hider\nof them all is the landrail. This harsh-voiced bird reaches our shores\nin May, and it was on the last of that month that I lately heard its\nrasping note in a quiet park not a mile out of a busy market town on the\nWelsh border, and forgave its monotone because, more emphatically than\neven the cuckoo\'s dissyllable, it announced that, at last, "summer was\nicumen in." This feeble-looking but indomitable traveller is closely\nassociated during its visit with the resident partridge. They nest in\nthe same situations, hiding in the fields of grass and standing corn,\nand eventually being flushed in company by September guns walking\nabreast through the clover-bud. Sport is not the theme of these notes,\nand it will therefore suffice to remark in passing on the curious manner\nin which even good shots, accustomed to bring down partridges with some\napproach to certainty, contrive to miss these lazy, flapping fowl when\nwalking them up. Dispassionately considered, the landrail should be a\nbird that a man could scarcely miss on the first occasion of his\nhandling a gun; in cold fact, it often survives two barrels apparently\nuntouched. This immunity it owes in all probability to its slow and\nheavy flight, since those whose eyes are accustomed to the rapid\nmovement of partridges are apt to misjudge the allowance necessary for\nsuch a laggard and to fire in front of it. It is difficult to realise\nthat, whereas the strong-winged partridge is a stay-at-home, the\ndeliberate landrail has come to us from Africa and will, if spared by\nthe guns, return there.\n\nPerhaps the most curious and interesting habit recorded of the landrail\nis that of feigning death when suddenly discovered, a method of\nself-defence which it shares with opossums, spiders, and in fact other\nanimals of almost every class. It will, if suddenly surprised by a dog,\nlie perfectly still and betray no sign of life. There is, however, at\nleast one authentic case of a landrail actually dying of fright when\nsuddenly seized, and it is a disputed point whether the so-called\npretence of death should not rather be regarded as a state of trance.\nStrict regard for the truth compels the admission that on the only\noccasion on which I remember taking hold of a live corncrake the bird,\nso far from pretending to be dead, pecked my wrist heartily.\n\nJust as the countryfolk regard the wryneck as leader of the wandering\ncuckoos, and the short-eared owl as forerunner of the woodcocks, so the\nancients held that the landrail performed the same service of pioneer to\nthe quail on its long journeys over land and sea. Save in exceptional\nyears, England is not visited by quail in sufficient numbers to lend\ninterest to this aspect of a bird attractive on other grounds, but the\ncoincidence of their arrival with us is well established.\n\nThe voice of the corncrake, easily distinguished from that of any other\nbird of our fields, may be approximately reproduced by using a blunt saw\nagainst the grain on hard wood. So loud is it at times that I have heard\nit from the open window of an express train, the noise of which drowned\nall other birdsong, and it seems remarkable that such a volume of sound\nshould come from a throat so slender. Yet the rasping note is welcome\nduring the early days of its arrival, since, just as the cuckoo gave\nearlier message of spring, so the corncrake, in sadder vein, heralds the\nripeness of our briefer summer.\n\nThe East Anglian name "dakker-hen" comes from an old word descriptive of\nthe bird\'s halting flight; and indeed to see a landrail drop, as already\nmentioned, after flying a few yards, makes one incredulous when tracing\nits long voyages on the map. In the first place, however, it should be\nremembered that the bird does not drop back in the grass because it is\ntired, but solely because it knows the way to safety by running out of\nsight. In the second, the apparent weakness of its wings is not real.\nQuails have little round wings that look ill adapted to long journeys. I\nhave been struck by this times and again when shooting quail in Egypt\nand Morocco, yet of the quail\'s fitness for travel there has never,\nsince Bible days, been any question.\n\nThe landrail is an excellent table bird. Personally I prefer it to the\npartridge, but this is perhaps praising it too highly. Legally of\ncourse it is "game," as a game licence must be held by anyone who shoots\nit; and, though protected in this country only under the Wild Birds Act,\nIrish law extends this by a month, so that it may not be shot in that\ncountry after the last day of January. Like most migratory birds, its\nnumbers vary locally in different seasons, and its scarcity in\nHampshire, to which White makes reference, has by no means been\nmaintained of recent years, as large bags have been recorded in every\npart of that county.\n\nThe common partridge is--at any rate for the naturalist--a less\ninteresting subject than its red-legged cousin, which seems to have been\nfirst introduced from France (or possibly from the island of Guernsey,\nwhere it no longer exists) in the reign of Charles II. That this early\nexperiment was not, however, attended by far-reaching results seems\nprobable, since early in the reign of George III we find the Marquis of\nHertford and other well-known sporting landowners making fresh attempts,\nthe stock of "Frenchmen" being renewed from time to time during the\nnext fifty years, chiefly on the east side of England, where they have\nalways been more in evidence than farther west. In Devon and Cornwall,\nindeed, the bird is very rare, and in Ireland almost unknown.\n\nIts red legs stand it in good stead, for it can run like a hare, and in\nthis way it often baffles the guns. It is not, however, so much its\nreluctance to rise that has brought it into disrepute with keepers as\nits alleged habit of ousting the native bird, in much the same way as\nthe "Hanover" rat has superseded the black aboriginal, although far from\nthe "Frenchman" driving the English partridge off the soil, there\nappears to be even no truth in the supposed hostility between the two,\nsince they do not commonly affect the same type of country; and even\nwhen they meet they nest in close proximity and in comparative harmony.\nNevertheless the males, even of the same species, are apt to be\npugnacious in the breeding season.\n\nBoth the partridge and landrail run serious risk from scythe and plough\nwhile sitting on the nest. Landrails have before now been decapitated by\nthe swing of the scythe, and a case is on record in which a sitting\npartridge, seeing that the plough was coming dangerously near her nest,\nactually removed the whole clutch of eggs, numbering over a score, to\nthe shelter of a neighbouring hedge. This was accomplished, probably\nwith the help of the male, during the short time it took the plough to\nget to the end of the field and back, and is a remarkable illustration\nof devotion and ingenuity. Not for nothing indeed is the partridge a\ngame bird, for it has been seen to attack cats, and even foxes, in\ndefence of the covey; and I have seen, in the MS. notes of the second\nEarl of Malmesbury, preserved in the library at Heron Court, mention of\none that drove off a carrion crow that menaced the family. Both\npartridge and landrail sit very close, particularly when the time of\nhatching is near, and Charles St. John saw a partridge, which his dog,\nhaving taken off the nest, was forced to drop, none the worse for her\nadventure, go straight back to her duties; though, as he adds, if it had\nnot been that she knew that the eggs were already chipping she would in\nall probability have deserted her post for good and all.\n\nWhether or not France is to be regarded as the original home of the "red\nleg," the fact remains that in that country it is becoming scarcer every\nyear, its numbers being maintained only in Brittany, Calvados, Orne, and\nSarthe. Its distribution in Italy is equally capricious, for it is\nvirtually restricted to the rocky slopes of the Apennines, the\nVolterrano Hills in Tuscany, and the coast ranges of Elba. It seems\ntherefore that in Continental countries, as well as with us, the bird\nextends its range reluctantly. Game-preservers seem, however, to agree\nthat partridges and pheasants are, beyond a certain point, incompatible\nas, with a limited supply of natural food, the smaller bird goes to the\nwall. Like most birds, partridges grow bold when pressed by cold and\nhunger, and I recollect hearing of a large covey being encountered ten\nor twelve years ago in an open space in the heart of the city of\nFrankfort.\n\n\n\n\nOCTOBER\n\nTHE MOPING OWL\n\n\n\n\nTHE MOPING OWL\n\n\nMusic, vocal or otherwise, is always a matter of taste, and individual\nappreciation of birdsong varies like the rest. One man finds the\ncuckoo\'s cry intolerably wearisome. Another sees no romance in the\ngargling of doves, while comparatively few care for the piercing scream\nof the starling or the rasping note of the corncrake. Yet few birds\nperform to a more hostile audience than the owl. I say advisedly "the\nowl," since the vast majority of people make no distinction whatever\nbetween our three resident kinds of owl, not to mention at least half a\ndozen more visitors. Some excuse for such carelessness might perhaps be\nfound in the similar flight and habits of different owls, but it might\nhave been thought that greater measure of individual recognition on\ntheir own merits would have been conceded to birds that range in size\nfrom the dimensions of a sparrow to those of a duck. But no; an owl is\njust an owl. Why the soft and haunting cry of these birds should not\nmerely displease, but actually alarm, so many people unaccustomed to\nsuch sounds of the gloaming and darkness it would be difficult to say;\nbut the voice of owls may possibly owe some of its disturbing effect to\ncontrast with their silent flight, which, thanks to their fluffy\nplumage, with its broad quills and long barbs, prevents their making\nmuch more noise than ghosts when hunting rats and mice in moonlit\nfields. Only one other English bird has so quiet a flight, and that is\nthe nightjar, another creature of the darkness, which, though no cousin\nto these nocturnal birds of prey, is known in some parts of the country\nas the "fern-owl." Visitors unprepared for the eerie woodland music of\nthese autumn nights shudder when they hear the cry of the owl, as if it\nsuggested midnight crime. For myself I have more agreeable associations,\nsince I never hear one of these birds without recalling a gallant fight\nI once had with a big Tweed salmon in the weak light of a young moon,\nwhile three owls hooted amid the ghostly ruins of Norham Castle. Yet,\neven apart from this wholly agreeable memory, I find nothing unpleasant\nin their music, and can readily conceive that the moping owl may sing to\nhis mate as passionately as Philomel.\n\nNot only is there the popular lack of distinction between one owl and\nanother already referred to, but scientific ornithologists have\ndisplayed similar want of finality in classifying these birds. There are\n(as in seals) eared and earless owls, though the so-called "ears" in the\nbirds are not actually ears at all, but tufts of feathers that give\nrather the impression of horns. There are bare-legged owls and owls with\nfeather stockings. There are owls that fly by day and owls that fly by\nnight, though this is a less satisfactory distinction than that between\nthe diurnal butterflies and nocturnal moths. Any reliable classification\nof owls must, in short, rest on certain structural bony differences of\ninterest only to the student of anatomy. Nearly all these birds are able\nto turn the outer toe completely round, and most of them, also, have\nvery keen hearing, which must be an invaluable aid when hunting small\nanimals in the dark.\n\nDid the ancients actually regard the owl as a wise bird, or was the\nfashion of depicting it in the following of Minerva merely dictated by\nthe presence of these birds on the Akropolis? It seems hardly\nconceivable that they could so have blundered as to call the owls that\nwe know clever birds; and the alternative assumption that owlish\nintellect can have appreciably changed in the interval is even less\nacceptable. It is probable that too much significance need not be\nattached to such association between the Greek goddess of wisdom and her\nattendant owls, for Hindu symbolism represented Ganesa, god of wisdom,\nwith the head of an elephant, yet that animal, which the natives of\nIndia know better than the men of any other race, has never figured in\ntheir folklore as a type noted for its cunning. About the owl as we know\nit to-day, with its spectacled face and blinking eyes, there is nothing\nstrikingly intelligent, and schoolboy slang, in which the word does duty\nas synonymous with foolishness, discovers a more accurate appreciation\nof these birds.\n\nSeen at its worst, when surprised in the glare of daylight and mobbed by\na furious rabble of little birds, an owl looks a helpless fool indeed,\nthough this is not the proper moment to judge of the bird\'s\npossibilities under happier circumstances. Why these small fowl should\nbully it at all is one of those woodland problems that no one has yet\nsolved. The first, and obvious, explanation is that they know it for\ntheir enemy, and it may be indeed that owls commit depredations on the\nnests of wild birds of which we, who academically regard their food as\nconsisting of rats, bats and mice--or, in the case of larger species, of\nyoung game and leverets--have no inkling. If however such is the case,\nit is strange that the habit should have been overlooked by those who\nhave paid close attention to this curious and interesting group.\nBird-catchers, at any rate, without troubling to inquire into the\nreason, turn the instinct to profitable account, and in some parts of\nthe country a stuffed owl is an important item of their stock-in-trade.\n\nThe majority of owls that either reside in or visit these islands are\nbenefactors of the farmer, and should be spared. The larger eagle-owl,\nand snowy owl eat more expensive food, though, seeing that they come to\nus--at any rate in the south country--only in winter, and even then\nirregularly, they can do no damage to young game birds, and are probably\nincapable of capturing old. The worst offender among the residents is\nthe tawny owl, to which I find the following reference in the famous\nMalmesbury MSS.: "Common here ... a great destroyer of young game and\nleverets ... they sit in ivy bushes during the day, and I have known one\nremain, altho\' its mate was killed, in the same tree, in such a state of\ntorpor did it appear to be...." The screech owl is a harmless bird and a\nterror to mice, and any doubt as to its claim on the farmer\'s\nhospitality would at once be removed by cursory examination of the\nundigested pellets which, in common with hawks, these birds cast up\nafter their meals.\n\nOn the other hand, there is sometimes good reason for modifying any plea\nfor kindness to owls. Handsome is as handsome does, and many of these\nbirds are, during the nesting season, not only savage in defence of\ntheir young, but actually so aggressive as to make unprovoked attack on\nall and sundry who unwittingly approach closer to the tree than these\ndevoted householders think desirable. Accounts of this troublesome mood\nin nesting owls come from several parts of the country, and notably from\nWales. In one case on record a pair of barn owls had their home in a\ntree overlooking Milford Haven, and the vicinity of the nest soon became\ndangerous. The male owl tore a boy\'s ear, knocked a man down, and\nattacked numerous human beings and dogs that made use of a path leading\npast the tree; and these episodes were in fact of daily occurrence until\nsome one shot the bird. Another pair of barn owls nested in a wood on\nthe shore of Menai Strait, and in this case the young birds managed to\nfall out of the nest, and lay on the ground in full view of a public\nright of way. Why the old birds did not put their offspring back in the\nnest no one knew. Possibly they realised that the talons, which so\nefficiently gripped rats, might not prove gentle enough for the\ntransport of owlets. At any rate, whatever their reason, they left the\nyoung birds on the ground, feeding them in that position, and flew at\neveryone who passed that way, clawing face and ears, and eventually\nestablishing a reign of terror. Another owl behaved in somewhat similar\nfashion in a spinney close to Axmouth, South Devon, punishing a\ncoastguard so severely that the man took to his heels. Such determined\ntactics in defence of the young are the more singular when we remember\nthat owls are, in normal circumstances, shy and retiring birds. Yet they\noccasionally seem to be possessed by more sociable instincts, in proof\nof which one of the long-eared kind has been seen feeding in the company\nof tame hawks; a pair of owls once nested in a dovecote close to a\nkeeper\'s lodge in the Highlands; and wild owls have been known to pay\nnightly visits to a cage in the Botanic Gardens at Launceston\n(Tasmania), in order to bring food to their captive friends.\n\nEven apart from these rigorous measures of defence, the nesting habits\nof owls are not without interest. The majority lay their eggs in either\nhollow trees or ruins, and it is worth remark that these nocturnal\nbirds bring up their young in darkness, whereas the hawks--birds of\ndaylight--rear theirs in open nests, high up in trees or on rocky\nledges, in the full glare of the sun. One owl indeed habitually burrows\nin the prairies and pampas, in the curious company of marmots and\nrattlesnakes, and this burrowing habit is also, in some parts of the\nUnited States, adopted by the common barn owl. Owls generally brood from\nthe laying of the first egg, with the obvious result that young birds in\nvarious stages of plumage are found together in the nest. It has been\nsuggested that the body of the first to leave the egg helps to keep the\nunhatched eggs warm while the parents are away foraging, else its\npresence would be a serious handicap. The first little owl to hatch out\nis usually ready to leave the nest soon after the arrival of the last,\nthough these chicks come into the world more helpless even than the\nmajority of birds.\n\n\n\n\nNOVEMBER\n\nWATERFOWL\n\n\n\n\nWATERFOWL\n\n\nHad these notes been written from the standpoint of sport, the three\nfamiliar groups of birds, which together make up this world-wide aquatic\nfamily, might better have borne their alternative title "wildfowl" with\nits covert sneer at the hand-reared pheasant and artificially encouraged\npartridge that, between them, furnish so much comfortable sport to those\nwith no fancy for the arduous business of the mudflats. It is true that,\nof late years, the mallard has, in experienced hands, made a welcome\naddition to the bag in covert shooting, as those will remember who have\nshot the Lockwood Beat on the last day of the shoot at Nuneham; and\nthere is historic evidence of "wild" duck having been reared for\npurposes of sport with hawks in the reign of Charles I. Yet such\narmchair shooting of wildfowl was ignored by Colonel Hawker and the\nsecond Earl of Malmesbury, both of whom, gunning in the creeks and\nestuaries of the south coast, made immense bags of ducks and geese,\nworking hard for every bird and displaying Spartan indifference to the\nrigours of wintry weather. To hardy sportsmen of their type, wildfowl\noffer red-letter days with punt or shoulder guns, not to be dreamt of\nunder the ægis of the gamekeeper.\n\nIn this country, at any rate, we associate the V-shaped companies of\nwigeon and gaggles of geese with an ice-bound landscape, though in\nexceptional years, even where they no longer stay to breed, these\nnight-flying northerners linger to the coming of spring, and Hawker\nnoticed the curious apparition of grey geese and swallows in company on\nthe first day of April, 1839. This wedge formation of flight over land\nand sea is not only peculiar to these waterfowl, but is not apparently\nadopted by any other long distance migrants. No satisfactory explanation\nof their preference for flying in this order has been found, but it is\nthought to lessen the air resistance, which must be a consideration for\nthese short-pinioned fowl that weigh heavy in proportion to their\ndisplacement and at the same time lack the tremendous spread of wing\nthat enables the wandering albatross to soar for days together over the\nillimitable ocean. With one noticeable exception, these waterfowl\nexhibit a more extraordinary range of size and weight than any other\nfamily of birds, from the whooper swan, five feet long and twenty-five\npounds on the scales, down to the little teal, with an overall\nmeasurement of only fourteen inches and a weight that does not exceed as\nmany ounces. The only other family of birds running to such extremes is\nthat of the birds of prey, which include at once the stately condor of\nthe Andes with its wing-spread of fifteen feet, and the miniature\nred-legged falconet of India and adjoining countries, in which the same\nmeasurement would scarcely reach as many inches.\n\nSince even game birds are derisively referred to as "tame" only by those\nignorant of the facts, the birds now under notice differ in this respect\nfrom all those previously dealt with; and they are geographically apart,\nagain, from our other domesticated animals, since they are not, like the\nbarndoor fowl and most of the rest, of Asiatic origin, but must often,\nin the grey of a winter morning, be conscious of their near relations\nflying at liberty across the sky. The geese and ducks have been\nremarkably transformed by the process of domestication, and a comparison\nbetween those of the farmyard and their kindred in the marshes should\nillustrate not only the relative value of most virtues, but also the\nall-importance of Aristotle\'s how, when and where. Strictly speaking, no\ndoubt, the tame birds have degenerated, both mentally and physically, as\nsurely as the tame ass. They have lost the acute perceptions and swift\nflight of their wild relations. Economically, on the other hand, they\nare immeasurably improved, since the farmer, indifferent to the more\ninspiring personality of the grey goose and the mallard, merely wants\nhis poultry to be greedy and stupid, fattening themselves incessantly\nfor Leadenhall and easily captured when required.\n\nBetween swans, geese and ducks there is little anatomical difference,\nsave in the matter of size. The swans are the giants of the race, and\nthe swans of three continents are white. It was left for Australia, land\nof topsy-turveydom, to produce a black swan (I spare the reader the\nobvious classical tag), and this remarkable bird, first observed by\nEuropeans in the early days of 1697, was quickly brought to Europe and\nfigures in the earliest list of animals shown in the London Zoological\nGardens. All these birds have a curious trick of hissing when angry, and\nthis habit, perhaps because it is usually accompanied by a deliberate\nstretching of the neck to its full length, is seriously regarded by some\nas conscious mimicry of snakes, a proposition that must be left to\nindividual taste, but that strikes me as somewhat far-fetched. At any\nrate, it gives to these birds a formidable air, and, though the current\nbelief in its power of breaking a man\'s arm with a blow from its wing is\nprobably unwarranted, an angry swan, disturbed on its nest, is an\nawesome apparition of which I have twice taken hurried leave. On the\nfirst occasion, I had nothing but a valuable camera with me, and it was,\nin fact, after a futile attempt to photograph the bird on the nest that\nI was moved to seek the boat and push off from the little island in the\nUpper Thames on which it had its home. The other encounter was on a\nDevonshire trout stream, and my only weapon was a fragile trout rod. The\ncertainty that discretion is, under these circumstances, the better part\nof valour is emphasised by the knowledge that any violence to the bird\nwould probably lead to a prosecution. Even the smaller geese can inspire\nfear when they dash hissing at intruders; hence, no doubt, the\nnursemaid\'s favourite reproach of children too frightened to "say bo to\na goose," an expression made classical by Swift.\n\nThe majority of these waterfowl are insectivorous in the nursery stage\nand vegetarian when full grown. Fish forms an inappreciable portion of\ntheir food, with the two notorious exceptions of the goosander and\nmerganser, though anglers are much exercised over the damage, real or\nalleged, done by these birds to their favourite roach and dace in the\nThames. These swans belong for the most part to either the Crown or the\nDyers\' and Vintners\' Companies, and the practice of "uppings," which\nconsists in marking the beaks of adult birds and pinioning the cygnets,\nis still, though shorn of some of its former ceremonial, observed some\ntime during the month of June.\n\nSwans, like both of the other groups, are distinguished by a separate\nname for either sex: pen and cob for the swan, gander and goose, drake\nand duck, and the figurative use of some of these terms in such popular\nsayings as "making ducks and drakes of money," "sauce for the goose,"\netc., is too familiar to call for more than passing mention.\n\nNearly all these waterfowl, though seen on dry land to much the same\ndisadvantage as fish out of water, are exceedingly graceful in either\nair or water, though not all ducks are as capable of diving as the name\nwould imply. The proverbial futility of a wild goose chase recognises\nthe pace of these birds on the wing, which, though, in common with that\nof some other birds, popularly exaggerated, is considerably faster than,\nowing to their short wings and heavy build, might appear to the careless\nobserver.\n\nDucks have a curious habit of adding down to the nest after the eggs are\nlaid and before incubation, and this provision of warm packing is turned\nto account in Iceland and other breeding places of the eider duck,\ncommercially the most valuable of all ducks. The nest is robbed of this\ndown once before the eggs hatch out, with the result that the female\nplucks another store from her own breast, supplemented if necessary from\nthe body of the drake. The sitting bird is then left in peace till the\nnest has fulfilled its purpose, when the remaining down is likewise\nremoved. This down, which combines warmth and lightness, gives a high\nmarket value to the eider, which, throughout Scandinavian countries is\nstrictly protected by law and even more effectually by public opinion.\n\nThe majority of ornamental ducks interbreed freely in captivity. Those\nwho, apparently on reliable evidence, distinguish between the polygamous\nhabit in tame ducks and the constancy of the mallard and other wild\nkinds to a single mate have hastily assumed that such hybrids are\nunknown in the natural state. This, however, is incorrect, as there have\nbeen authentic cases of crosses between mallard and teal, pochard and\nscaup and other species, such hybrids having at different times been\nerroneously accepted as distinct species and named accordingly.\n\nThe wild duck\'s nest is usually placed on the ground in some sheltered\nspot close to still or running water, and the ducklings swim like corks,\nsoon learning the proper use of their flat little bills in gobbling up\nfloating insects and other waterlogged food. Occasionally ducks nest in\ntrees and they have been known to take possession of a deserted rook\'s\nnest. There has been some discussion as to whether, in this case, the\nmother conveys her ducklings to the water in her bill, but this has not\nactually been witnessed. In cases where, as is often observed, the nest\noverhangs the water, it has been suggested that the young birds may\nsimply be pushed over the edge and allowed to parachute down to the\nsurface, as they might easily do without risk.\n\nTame ducks are among the most sociable of birds and can even display\nbravery when threatened by a common enemy. The naturalist Houssay once\nlearnt this as the result of a somewhat cruel experiment that he made in\norder to ascertain whether ducks invariably, as alleged, fall upon a\nwounded comrade and destroy it. Wishing to satisfy himself on the point,\nHoussay, having come upon some ducks in a small pond, deliberately\npelted them with stones till he had wounded one of their number.\nInstead, however, of behaving as he had been led to expect, the rest of\nthe ducks formed close order round the wounded bird and sheltered it\nfrom further harm.\n\nFew domestic animals--none, possibly, with the single exception of the\ncamel--are less suggestive of "pets" than such gross poultry, yet even a\ngander, the most vicious tempered of them all, has been known to show\nlasting gratitude for an act of kindness. The bird, which had long been\nthe terror of children in the little Devonshire village near which it\nlived, managed one day to get wedged in a drain, and there it would\neventually have died unseen if a passing labourer had not seen its\nplight and set it at liberty. Down to the day of its death the bird,\nthough nowise relinquishing its spiteful attitude towards others,\nfollowed its rustic benefactor about the place like a dog.\n\n\n\n\nDECEMBER\n\nTHE ROBIN REDBREAST\n\n\n\n\nTHE ROBIN REDBREAST\n\n\nOf all the old proverbs that are open to argument, few offer more\nmaterial for criticism than that which has it that a good name is more\neasily lost than won; and if ever a living creature served to illustrate\nthe converse to the proverbial dog with a bad name, that creature is the\ncompanionable little bird that we peculiarly associate with Christmas.\nTraditionally, the robin is a gentle little fellow of pious associations\nand with a tender fancy for covering the unburied dead with leaves; but\nin real life he is a little fire-eater, always ready to pick a quarrel\nwith his less pugnacious neighbours. Yet so persistently does his good\nname cling, that, while ever ready to condemn the aggressive sparrow for\nthe same fault, all of us have a good word for the robin, and in few of\nour wild birds are character and reputation so divergent.\n\nSurely, however, the most interesting aspect of this familiar bird is\nits tameness, not to say attachment to ourselves, and so marked is its\ncomplete absence of fear that it is a wild bird in name only, and\nindeed few cage birds are ever so bold as to perch on the gardener\'s\nspade on the look-out for the worms as he turns them up from the damp\nsoil. The robin might, in fact, furnish the text of a lay-sermon on the\nfruits of kindness to animals, and those dialectical people who ask\nwhether we are kind to the robin because it trusts us, or whether, on\nthe other hand, it trusts us because we are kind to it, ask a foolish\nquestion that raises a wholly unnecessary confusion between cause and\neffect. It is a question that those, at any rate, who have seen the bird\nin countries where it is treated differently will have no difficulty\nwhatever in answering. Broadly speaking, the redbreast has the best time\nof it in northern lands. This tolerance has not, as has been suggested,\nany connection with Protestantism, for such a distinction would exclude\nthe greater part of Ireland, where, as it happens, the bird is as safe\nfrom persecution as in Britain, since the superstitious peasants firmly\nbelieve that anyone killing a "spiddog" will be punished by a lump\ngrowing on the palm of his hand. The untoward fate of the robin in Latin\ncountries bordering the Mediterranean has nothing to do with religion,\nbut is merely the result of a pernicious habit of killing all manner of\nsmall birds for the table. The sight of rows of dead robins laid out on\npoulterers\' stalls in the markets of Italy and southern France inspires\nsuch righteous indignation in British tourists as to make them forget\nfor the moment that larks are exposed in the same way in Bond Street and\nat Leadenhall. In Italy and Provence, taught by sad experience the robin\nis as shy as any other small bird. It has learnt its lesson like the\nrobins in the north, but the lesson is different. The most friendly\nrobin I ever remember meeting with, out of England was in a garden\nattached to a café in Trebizond, where, hopping round my chair and\npicking up crumbs, it made me feel curiously at home. Similar treatment\nof other wild birds would in time produce the same result, and even the\nsuspicious starling and stand-off rook might be taught to forget their\nfear of us. The robin, feeding less on fruit and grain than on worms and\ninsects, has not made an enemy of the farmer or gardener. The common,\ntoo common, sparrow, is another fearless neighbour, but its freedom\nfrom persecution, of late somewhat threatened by Sparrow Clubs, is due\nless to affection than to the futility of making any impression on such\nhordes as infest our streets.\n\nNo act of the robin\'s more forcibly illustrates its trust in man than\nthe manner in which, at a season when all animals are abnormally shy and\nsuspicious, it makes its nest not only near our dwellings, but actually\nin many cases under the same roof as ourselves. Letterboxes, flowerpots,\nold boots, and bookshelves have all done duty, and I even remember a\npair of robins, many years ago in Kent, bringing up two broods in an old\nrat trap which, fortunately too rusty to act, was still set and baited\nwith a withered piece of bacon. Pages might be filled with the mere\nenumeration of curious and eccentric nesting sites chosen by this\nfearless bird, but a single proof of its indifference to the presence of\nman during the time of incubation may be cited from the MS. notebooks of\nthe second Earl of Malmesbury, which I have read in the library at Heron\nCourt. It seems that, while the east wing of that pleasant mansion was\nbeing built, a pair of robins, having successfully brought up one family\nin one of the unfinished rooms, actually reared a second brood in a hole\nmade for a scaffold-pole, though the sitting bird, being immediately\nbeneath a plank on which the plasterers stood at work, was repeatedly\nsplashed with mortar! The egg of the robin is subject to considerable\nvariety of type. I think it was the late Lord Lilford who, speaking on\nthe subject of a Bill for the protection of wild birds\' eggs, then\nbefore the House of Lords, gave it as his belief that no ornithologist\nof repute would swear to the name of a single British bird\'s egg without\npositively seeing one or other of the parent birds fly off the nest.\nThis was, perhaps, a little overstating the difficulty of evidence,\nsince any schoolboy with a fancy for birds-nesting might without\nhesitation identify such pronounced types as those of the chaffinch,\nwith its purple blotches, the song-thrush with its black spots on a blue\nground, or the nightingale, which resembles a miniature olive. Eggs, on\nthe other hand, like those of the house sparrow, redshank and some of\nthe smaller warblers, are so easily confused with those of allied\nspecies that Lord Lilford\'s caution is by no means superfluous.\nOrdinarily speaking, the robin\'s egg is white, with red spots at one\nend, but I remember taking at Bexley, nearly thirty years ago, an\nimmaculate one of coffee colour. As the robin is a favourite\nfoster-parent with cuckoos, my first thought was that this might be an\nunusually small egg of the parasitic bird, which was very plentiful\nthereabouts. It so happened, however, that three days after I had\nabstracted the first and only egg I took from that nest, there was a\nsecond of the same type; and, much as I would have liked this also for\nmy collection, I left it in the nest so as to set all doubts at rest. My\nmoderation was rewarded, for no one else found the nest, and in due\ncourse the coffee-coloured egg produced a robin like the rest.\n\nThe robin is anything but a gregarious bird. Its fighting temper\ndoubtless leads it to keep its own company, and we rarely see more than\none singing on the same bush, or seeking for food on the same lawn. Yet,\nthough it is with us all the year, it is known to perform migrations\nwithin these islands, and possibly also overseas, chiefly connected with\ncommissariat difficulties, and it is probable that on such occasions\nmany robins may travel in company, though I have not been so fortunate\nas to come across them in their pilgrimage. Equally interesting,\nhowever, is the habit which the bird has in Devonshire of occasionally\ngoing down to the rocks on the seashore, as I have often noticed in the\nneighbourhood of Teignmouth and Torquay. What manner of food the\nredbreast may find in such surroundings is a mystery, but there it\ncertainly spends some of its time, bobbing at the edge of the rock pools\nin much the same fashion as the dipper on inland waters.\n\nYoung robins are turned adrift at an early age to look after themselves,\na result of the parent bird always rearing two families in the year, and\nin many cases even three, so that they have not too much time to devote\nto the upbringing of each. Another consequence of this prolific habit is\nthat the robin has to make its nest earlier than most of our wild birds,\nand its nest has, in fact, been found near Torquay during the first week\nof January.\n\nIt has long been the pardonable fancy of Englishmen exiled to new homes\nunder the palms or pines, in the scorching tropical sun or in the biting\nnorthern blast, to misname all manner of conspicuous birds after\nwell-remembered kinds left at home in the woods and fields of the old\ncountry. As might be expected of a bird so characteristic of English\nscenes, and so closely associated with the festival that always brings\nnostalgia to the emigrant, the robin has its share of these namesakes,\nand several of them bear little likeness to the original. In New South\nWales, I remember being shown a "robin" which, though perhaps a little\nsmaller, was not unlike our own bird, but the "robin" that was pointed\nout to me in the States, from Maine to Carolina, was as big as a thrush.\nYet it had the red breast, by which, particularly conspicuous against a\nbackground of snow, this popular little bird is always recognisable, the\nmale as well as the female. Indeed, to all outward appearance the sexes\nare absolutely alike, a striking contrast to the cock and hen pheasant,\nthe first bird dealt with in these notes, as this is the last.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s Birds in the Calendar, by Frederick G.

In spite of the\nconsiderable progress made towards that end, many typical specimens\nare still wanting, and, while we have plenty of material for the study\nof weaving in various parts of the world, we are lacking in everything\nrelating to the industry in Ancient Egypt and Greece. Failing\nspecimens I have had recourse to illustrations, but the Egyptian ones\npublished by Cailliaud, Rosellini, Sir J. G. Wilkinson and Lepsius,\ncontradict each other in many important points, so that those who\nstudy them find them practically useless for an understanding of the\nart as carried on in the Nile lands. Fortunately, last year, Mr. N. de\nG. Davies, the well-known Egyptologist, hearing of my difficulty, very\ngenerously placed some of his copies of tomb drawings at my disposal,\nand with this invaluable help I have been enabled to complete the\npresent paper, and to lay before Halifax students some new details of\nmanufacture bearing upon their staple industry.\n\n                                                  H. Ling Roth.\n\n  Bankfield Museum, Halifax.\n  April 1913.\n\n\n\n\nI. EGYPTIAN LOOMS.\n\n\nHORIZONTAL LOOMS.[A]\n\nIn the tomb of Chnem-hotep, at Beni Hasan, there is a wall painting of\na horizontal loom with two weavers, women, squatting on either side,\nand at the right in the background is drawn the figure of the\ntaskmaster. There are also figures represented in the act of spinning,\netc. For the present we are concerned with the weaving only.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from the\nillustration in Cailliaud\'s _Recherches_, etc. Same size as\npublished.]\n\nOf this illustration, there appear to be six reproductions. We have\nfirst of all, Fig. 1, that of Fred. Cailliaud (_Recherches sur les\nArts et Métiers_, etc., Paris, 1831) with illustrations of drawings\nmade by himself in the years 1819 to 1822. His publication was\nfollowed by Fig. 2, that of Sir J. G. Wilkinson (_Manners and\nCustoms_, etc., London, 1837). Mr. John Murray, whose house has\npublished Wilkinson\'s work from the first edition to the last, informs\nme that a few of the drawings were made by George Scharf, afterwards\nSir George Scharf, Keeper of the National Portrait Gallery, but that\nmost of them seem to have been made by Joseph Bonomi, the well known\nEgyptologist. Wilkinson\'s woodcut, although clearly and neatly done,\nis on a very small scale; nevertheless it admits of a fair comparison\nwith those reproduced on a larger scale.\n\n[Illustration:\n\n    Figs. 1 & 3.

Same size as published.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep, from\nProf. Percy Newberry\'s _Beni Hasan_, I. Plate 29. Same size as\npublished.]\n\nAfter him, Fig. 3, N. F. J. B. Rosellini began the publication of his\ngreat work (_I Monumenti dell\' Egitto_, Pisa, 1832-1844). The\nsimilarity between the comparatively few drawings published by\nCailliaud and the very large number published by Rosellini is very\ngreat. It is of course quite possible Rosellini may have made use of\nsome of Cailliaud\'s drawings. Five years after Rosellini\'s publication\ncame that of C. R. Lepsius (_Denkmäler_, Leipzig, 1849), Fig. 4, his\ndrawings having been made in the years 1842 to 1845. Since the time of\nLepsius until quite recent years I can trace no further copying until\nwe get the illustration, Fig. 5, in Prof. Percy Newberry\'s _Beni\nHasan_, London, 1910. In this work the reproduction is about one\ntwentieth of the original, or about three fifths of the size of that\nof Wilkinson, and unfortunately so crude as not to be available for\nour present purpose.[B] Lastly we have the reproduction, Fig. 6, from\nMr. N. de Garis Davies\' drawing made in 1903, and now first published\nby kind permission of Mr. F. Ll. Griffith.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Horizontal Loom, Tomb of Chnem-hotep. Size of\noriginal: Height of the figures 9-1/4" = 24·4 cm. Drawn by Mr. N. de\nG. Davies, and now published for the first time by permission of Mr.\nF. Ll. Griffith.]\n\nIn the various reproductions by the above explorers, the only three\nwhich agree very closely are those of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies.\nThe others vary considerably and in essentials do not agree with the\nabove nor with one another. The differences may in the first instance\nbe due to difficulties in copying the original in the tomb. Others may\nbe due to ignorance of detail on the part of the secondary\ncopyist--the man who prepared them for publication--so that he was\nunable to follow up the clues on the drawings laid before him. The\ndifferences may also be due to careless copying and to "touching up"\nof the copies when made; they may be slightly due to deterioration and\nobliteration of the original in the course of time.\n\nThe _Encyclopædia Biblica_ gives a variant from all six illustrations,\nbut approaching nearest to that of Cailliaud, Rosellini and Davies. It\nis misleading in so far that the drawing has been made to suit\nProfessor Kennedy\'s idea as to what it should be.\n\nSome of the differences are of minor importance, but a comparison will\nhelp materially to our understanding of the method of weaving adopted\nby the Egyptians from the XIIth to the XIXth Dynasties, or about B.C.\n2000 to 1200. To go into details, and taking Mr. N. de G. Davies\'\nillustration as our basis, we find slight differences in the shape of\nthe pegs B, B1, which are immaterial. A more pronounced difference is\nseen in the way in which the threads are attached to the warp beam A.\nNeither Wilkinson nor Lepsius carry these threads over the beam, the\nformer carrying them only as far as the laze threads C, while the\nlatter carries them up to a line drawn parallel to and below the beam;\nCailliaud and Rosellini carry them over the beam while Mr. Davies\ncarries them half way only. The object of this half carrying over is\nnot clear. The threads in chain-form at C are probably laze threads,\napparently placed there so that in case of any disarrangement of the\nwarp threads the weaver can from that point run her fingers along them\nand get them disentangled. It has been suggested to me that this\nchain-form might be a tension chain for taking up slack warp, but the\nformer explanation seems the more likely.\n\nAll the drawings but Wilkinson\'s show the warp threads converging\ntowards the breast beam; Wilkinson shows them parallel and in Lepsius\ntheir convergence is excessive. There should be a slight convergence\nshown, as in the course of weaving the threads get drawn in, and in\nlater forms of looms in semi-civilised countries we find an endeavour\nto counteract this tendency by the use of a tool known as a "temple."\n\nThe cross sticks D1, D2, look like laze rods. It may not be out of\nplace here to point out that in primitive weaving laze rods serve two\npurposes, or one more than in the later somewhat more advanced looms.\nThey serve throughout to keep the warp threads in place, and they\nserve to separate the odd threads from the even (1, 3, 5, 7 from 2, 4,\n6, 8, &c.), and in so doing take the place of the fingers in making\nthe "shed," _i.e._, the opening through which the "weft (or woof)" is\npassed, a function which in turn is usurped by the "heald (or\nheddle)." The heddle therefore becomes a very important factor, and\nDr. H. G. Harrison by no means overstates the case when he says that\nthe development of the heddle is the most important step in the\nevolution of the loom (Horniman Museum Handbooks, No. 10, pp. 47-49).\nWe may now return to the drawing. Wilkinson shows the rod D1\nindistinctly and the left hand end only of D2. Lepsius\' artist seems\nto have taken a liberty with D1 but in the right direction, by making\nit more definitely into an early form of heddle--the loop and rod--but\nhe shows D2 the same as Cailliaud and Rosellini. Prof. Kennedy argues\nthat these rods are in the wrong position and that D1 which is a\nheddle should be in the place of D2. Mr. Davies\' drawing as well as\nthose of Cailliaud and Rosellini show that D1 is a heddle while D2 is\nshown to be a laze rod. Asiatic primitive looms, like those from\nBorneo and Bhutan, have two laze rods but no heddle; on the other hand\nmany primitive African looms have one laze rod and one heddle as is\nthe case with this Egyptian loom. More threads are shown on the left\nhand end of D2 than on the right hand end. Mr. Davies informs me that\nthe same quantity should be shown from end to end across the warp, but\non the right hand side they are so indistinct that he was just able to\ndetect but not to trace them and so he omitted them.\n\nWe now come to the rod E. Cailliaud and Rosellini show an undulation\nat the one end _a_, but do not make the other end clear. Wilkinson\nshows a small hook at the end _a_, which appears to me to be a\ntranscriber\'s development of the curved end of his two predecessors;\nin the text Wilkinson says there is a hook at each end of this stick,\nbut he does not show any at the end opposite to _a_; he refers to\nthese hooks more than once (1st ed., III., p. 126 footnote). Lepsius\nhas altered the shape of the curve and transferred it from the end _a_\nto the opposite end. In Mr. de G. Davies\' drawing, it has been\ninserted in dotted lines, as the original is in such a state that\ntracing is almost impossible. Wilkinson, Erman, v. Cohausen (_Das\nSpinnen u. Weben bei den Alten_, in _Ann. Ver. Nassau. Altherthumsk._,\nWiesbaden, 1879, p. 29), and others call it a shuttle, but I am more\ninclined to consider it a slashing stick ("sword" or "beater-in") for\npushing the weft into position. A tool which appears to be a beater-in\nand of similar end shape is seen held in the hand of a woman on a\nwall painting at El Bersheh--see Fig. 11, top right-hand corner. We\nhave in another illustration, Fig. 7, an article which appears to be a\nspool, which I think confirms the view that E is not the shuttle but\nthe beater-in. In all the illustrations, too, the pose of the hands of\nthe women bearing on this stick is indicative of a downward pressure\nand not of a grasp.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Tomb of the Vizier Daga. Date about end XI.\nDynasty, B.C. 2000. Mr. N. de G. Davies\' _Five Theban Tombs_, Plate\nXXXVII.\n\nThe upper illustration indicates a woman warping or beaming, probably\nwarping.\n\nIn the lower illustration note the left hand figure holding the spool\nin her hand. At first sight this small black line looks like a\ncontinuation of the "beater-in" in the hands of the other weaver, but\nMr. Davies informs me that it is quite a distinct article, and that\nthere can be no doubt about it. Just above the breast beam there are 8\nor 9 threads of weft but they are too faint to be included.]\n\nThe selvedge F on the one side of the cloth and not on both sides is\nalso interesting from the fact that selvedges do not appear on the\nEgyptian cloths until the XVIII. Dynasty _circa_ B.C. 1600.\n\nThe breast beam:--It appears to me that the three portions marked G1,\nG2 and G3 joined up are intended to represent the breast beam and its\nholding pegs, similar to the warp beam A and its pegs B1, B2, but the\nportion K is not clearly drawn in any of the reproductions. Wilkinson\nomits this altogether, but in its place has two black pieces which\nalso are still less clear. Lepsius has omitted G2 altogether and\nappears to have made G1 and K and G3 into treadles, by raising G1\nabove the level of G3, and to support the view that these are\ntreadles, he makes use of the overseer\'s foot by placing it on the\nsupposed treadle, and the casual observer thinks it is the foot of the\nwoman weaver. However, Mr. Davies\' copy seems to offer a solution. He\nagrees with Cailliaud and Rosellini in so far as G1, G2 and G3 are\nconcerned. With him K takes quite a different form, in fact it looks\nvery similar to an article which an attendant woman in another panel\nhas close by her, see Fig. 8. It might perhaps be a rest to prevent\nthe beater-in being driven home too forcibly--this, however, is still\nonly a surmise--as the length of the beater-in makes it heavy at the\nfar end.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.--Weaver with the support K, Fig. 6; the woman\nappears to hold a beater-in in the right hand and a ball of thread in\nthe left hand. Rosellini.]\n\nIn Cailliaud the warp threads are coloured in pale blue and red on top\nof the black lines of the drawing; he has painted the selvedge and\nfinished cloth a pale blue, as well as that portion of G2 which is\ncovered by the cloth indicating that this is the breast beam, G3 and\nG1 are painted a dark red. Rosellini colours A, B1, B2, D1, D2, G3\norange; G1 and K dark red, but E from end to end light ochre. This\nshows that K is distinct from E.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.\n\nUpright or Vertical Looms from the Tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, XVIII\nDynasty, _circa_ B.C. 1425. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies. Size\nof original: Height from Base Line to top of frame at A, 11-1/2" = 29\ncm.]\n\nIn consequence of this loom being represented as upright it is often\nspoken of as an upright or vertical loom. But it is drawn upright\nbecause the Egyptian artist did not understand perspective, and it was\nonly by making the loom upright that he was enabled to show the\ndetails we have just been examining. For the same reason mat making is\nillustrated edgeways. If the loom were an upright one the two women\nweavers would have had their backs turned towards the onlooker as can\nbe seen in Fig. 9. Any doubt on the matter has however been set aside\nby Prof. John Garstang\'s extremely interesting discovery of a wooden\nmodel depicting a group of women spinning and weaving which he\nillustrates in his work, _The Burial Customs of Ancient Egypt_,\nLondon, 1907. After referring to the woman spinning, he continues:\n"The other seated figures apparently represent women at work upon a\nhorizontal loom; the frame and the woof [_sic_, should be _warp_]\nthreads are faintly represented upon the board. It is possible that\nthey are making mats or, perhaps, weaving (p. 132)." He gives an\nillustration of the group taken from a photograph, but as it does not\nshow the lines which indicate the loom lying horizontally on the\nground nor the warp threads, I have asked him to let me have a drawing\nmade of it and, with his kind permission, it is now reproduced here,\nFig. 10. The threads of the warp and the finished piece of cloth at\nthe breast beam end are clearly indicated. The whole model supports\nconclusively the well founded supposition that the loom we have been\nconsidering is a _horizontal_ one. Curiously enough, Prof. Garstang\ndoes not appear to appreciate the important bearing of his discovery,\nfor on a later page (p. 134) in speaking of Lepsius\' illustration,\ndiscussed above, he says: "the weavers are seen at work at an upright\nloom."\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Horizontal Loom. Outline sketch by Miss Davey\nof the original model of a group of one woman spinning and two women\nweaving, found by Dr. John Garstang at Beni Hasan. The model is in the\nMuseum of the Liverpool Institute of Archæology.]\n\nIt must not be thought that the Beni Hasan representation is the only\none which illustrates a horizontal loom. A second one is reproduced by\nProf. Percy Newberry from the tomb of Tehuti-hetep _circa_ 1938-1849\nB.C., see Fig. 11. In the upper portion the women are seen spinning\nand preparing the thread generally, while in the lower portion two\nwomen on the left are warping, and in the centre three apparently are\n"beaming," _i.e._ putting the warp on to the beams preparatory to\ncommencing to weave, the warp threads being apparently drawn over pegs\nto ensure the proper tension. This illustration shows the warp flat\nagainst the wall like the mat making shown at Beni Hasan.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Tomb of Tehuti-hetep. Date about 1939-1849\nB.C. From Professor Percy Newberry\'s _El Bersheh_ I. Pl. 26.\n\nNote the woman on the top right hand corner holding a "beater-in."]\n\nA third representation of a horizontal loom is reproduced from the\nforthcoming volume of the Egypt Exploration Fund by kind permission of\nMr. N. de G. Davies, who made the copy. In this, Fig. 7, already\nreferred to, the lower portion is all that has come down to us. The\ncloth is not shown contracted as in the Beni Hasan representation, the\ntwo laze rods are drawn close to each other and here also an attempt\nappears to have been made to show the over and under lapping warp\nthreads; the laze rods appear each with a hook, the hook on the upper\nrod turned upwards and the hook (if it be one) on the lower rod turned\ndownwards. It is possible these hooks may be pegs to prevent the\nshifting of the laze rods. It may be that one of the two rods is a\nheddle rod the indication being the fine double lines, but this may\nnot be compatible with the hook at the end of the rod. The weaver on\nthe left holds a spool in her hand, evidently a piece of stick with\nthe weft thread wound round it, which she is pushing through with her\nfingers. The weaver on the right holds a beater-in as shown in the\nBeni Hasan drawing. The breast beam is held in position by two pegs\nnear the right one of which there is a curved article of indeterminate\nuse.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Study of a Bedawin Arab weaving, from a\nsketch taken in the Forties of last Century, by Frank Goodall, R.A.\nThe original sketch is in Bankfield Museum. The weaver appears to be\nprovided with one heddle and a beater-in.]\n\nThere is no very clear evidence as to how the finished cloth was\n"taken up" unless we accept it that the bulging out of the part G2\nmeans that it was wound round the breast beam as is done on hand and\npower looms of the present day. Some very long pieces of cloth have\ncome down to us and unless they were "taken up" in this way a long\nstretch of ground would have been necessary. A modified form of this\nhorizontal loom has been met with in recent years among the Bedawin\nArabs, as shown in the illustration of a study sketch, Fig. 12, made\nby Frank Goodall, R.A., in the forties of last century. The loom was\nprovided with pegs like the old Egyptian loom but it was supplied with\na primitive heddle resting on a stone at each side of the warp and it\nwould appear that the weaver, to a certain extent, did not take up the\nwoven cloth by winding it round the breast beam and by that means\nretaining his position, but, as the weaving progressed and the line of\nfinished cloth got beyond his reach, he crept up to it and so got\nfarther and farther away from the breast beam until in the end he\narrived at the warp beam. Similar looms are still used for mat making\nby the Egyptian fellah.\n\n\nVERTICAL LOOMS.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Upright or vertical loom. Wilkinson\'s\n_Ancient Egyptians_, London, John Murray. 1st ed., Vol. III., p. 135.]\n\nApart from the horizontal loom Wilkinson and Robert Hay[C] also\nrecorded the existence of an illustration of an upright loom, said in\nerror to be at Eileithyias (El Kab). Wilkinson\'s copy, Fig. 13, is\nmore elaborate than that of Hay. Mr. Davies informs me that the\noriginal is not at Eileithyias, but in the tomb of Nefer-hotep at\nThebes. Wilkinson in regard to this illustration quotes the\noft-repeated statement of Herodotus (_circa_ 460-455 B.C.) in\nreference to looms in general:--"Other nations make cloth by pushing\nthe woof upwards, the Egyptians on the contrary, press it down." On\nthis statement Wilkinson remarks: "This is confirmed by the paintings\nwhich represent the process of making cloth; but at Thebes, a man who\nis engaged in making a piece of cloth with a coloured border or\nselvedge, appears to push the woof upwards, the cloth being fixed\nabove him, to the upper part of the frame" [Fig. 13]. But I am unable\nto follow Wilkinson in this, for I can find no indication in his\nillustration which shows how the beating-in of the weft is\naccomplished. From the illustration all one can say is that it might\nhave been done either way. Wilkinson\'s illustration is lettered from\n_a_ to _p_ but this lettering is not explained by him at all,\nexcepting in the case of the letter _k_, of which he says: "_k_ is a\nshuttle, not thrown, but put in with the hand. It had a hook at the\nend ..." and he proceeds to refer to the drawing elsewhere of the\nhorizontal loom. He does not show the hooks in his illustration. In\nFig. 14, I give the sketch made by Mr. N. de G. Davies of the remains\nof the original from which Wilkinson made his illustration.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies, Jan. 1913, of\nan Upright Loom in Tomb 49 at Thebes, belonging to Nefer-hotep, at end\nof XVIII. Dynasty, B.C. 1330. Drawn when in a better state by\nWilkinson, Fig. 13, and Hay.]\n\nA more satisfactory drawing of upright looms is that which Mr. N. de\nG. Davies has placed at my disposal for reproduction here. I append\nhis description, Fig. 9. "The picture of men working at two looms is\ntaken from the tomb of Thot-nefer at Thebes, who was a royal scribe\nin the middle of the 18th Dynasty, _circa_ 1425 B.C. In his tomb his\nhouse is shown. He himself sits in the hall, while inside some\nservants spin and weave, make bread, store the grain, etc. The roof of\nthe chambers is supported on pillars, and between two of these the\nlooms are set up which are here depicted. They are not attached\nhowever, either to the roof or the pillars. Faint sketching lines are\nmixed up with the darker reds in which the picture was re-drawn, and\nthe whole very simply and carelessly executed. I have found it\ndifficult to make it clear. In my sketch the first faint sketching\noutlines appear as lines. The more solid red lines which replaced\nthese I have \'hatched,\' and certain portions including the men\'s flesh\ncolour, the stools, the discs I have put in solid black, partly\nbecause they are for the most part more solid and dark red in the\noriginal, and partly to distinguish the portions more clearly from one\nanother. The horizontal lines which cross the web are very faintly\ndrawn and almost as good as obliterated by the white paint which had\nbeen put on the web. I have put them in just to show that the bars\nwere _conceived_ of as passing behind or under the web and concealed\nby it.\n\n"The larger loom is worked by two men, the smaller by one man only.\nThe looms consist of an oblong frame A set up on two stones B. The\nwarp is attached to the warp beam C on top and the breast beam D at\nthe bottom. The threads of the warp are not shown, no difference being\nmade between any woven part and the warp threads; to all is given one\nsmear of white paint. Two discs E are seen hanging against the frame\nposts, one on each side, the earlier sketch showing a larger disc than\nthe final drawing in dark red.\n\n"Two slender laze rods F are shown on the large loom and heavy bars G,\nH, lower down; a somewhat similar laze rod and beams are also shown on\nthe smaller loom.\n\n"The weavers sit on benches with their backs to the spectator. The\nartist has not dared to draw a back view of their heads, but has\nturned each man\'s head to the right to show a profile. They are\nholding a heavy looking rod which looks like a \'beater-in.\' One would\nexpect to see a shuttle but perhaps this was too small an object for\nso rough a picture--perhaps the man at the smaller loom holds an\nexaggerated shuttle L in his right hand.\n\n"The lines M seen alongside the framework are the faint red sketch\nlines _not_ cords. The diagonal line N on the left I do not\nunderstand, it does not seem an accidental one.\n\n"On the left hand of the two looms the original shows a man spinning\ncoarse thread into finer(?) using two spindles at once; the threads\npass through rings fixed in the ceiling as in a picture at Beni Hasan.\nBehind him two girls are breaking up the flax and two others are\nmaking coarse threads of the fibres, almost exactly like those in the\ntomb of Daga (No. 103) a couple of hundred yards away."\n\nTo this description of Mr. Davies I would like to add a word about\nthe discs E. Wilkinson indicates these as rings apparently joining the\nhorizontal beam to the post of the frame, the form of the ring being\narrived at as explained by Mr. Davies by the original outline of the\nsketch having been made larger than the final drawing of the circle,\nor disc, and not obliterated. In Mr. Davies\' drawing these discs hang\non or are fixed on to the uprights only, and I am inclined to think\nthey represent balls of weft thread hanging up in the same way as we\nsee whole rows of coloured balls hanging on the looms of Persian\nrugmakers, and as can be seen on an Indian rug loom in Bankfield\nMuseum.\n\nIt is also very clear that these Egyptian vertical looms are very\ndifferent from the Greek looms in so far as we know anything about\nthem. The Greek looms had an upper beam only and the warp threads were\nbunched at the lower end and weighted with metal or clay balls to keep\nthem taut, Fig. 15. The _individual_ warp threads were not weighted;\nthey were bunched and then weighted. The pyramidal shaped clay warp\nweights found in Egypt are I understand considered by Egyptologists to\nbelong to the Roman period, but in the Manchester University Museum\nthere is a mud article which Miss M. A. Murray describes as a warp\nweight, Fig. 17, so that it is possible vertical looms with warp\nweights may yet be forthcoming as an Egyptian and not a foreign\nindustrial tool. But Dr. H. R. Hall informs me this weight was\nprobably found in the ruins of houses where Ægean pottery was found\nand hence it is probably a temporary warp weight of those people and\nnot an Egyptian article.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Greek loom with spool and warp weights.\nIllustration on a skyphos (van Branteghem vase in the Ashmolean\nMuseum, Oxford). From H. B. Walters\' paper on _Odysseus & Kirke_ on a\nBoeotian vase, Jour. Hellenic Studies, 1892-3 XIII. p. 81.]\n\nSince writing the above Mr. N. de G. Davies has very kindly sent me on\na new set of illustrations, Fig. 16, of which he says; "My attention\nwas called to the scene by Dr. Alan Gardiner. The scenes which\nrepresent the preparation of the flax and the stretching of the warp\nare almost replicas of those in the tomb of Daga of the Middle\nKingdom, so far as we can judge, while the pictures of the looms\nresemble closely those in the tombs of Thot-nefer and Nefer-hotep. The\nwork is done by both men and women. Men prepare the flax while women\nstretch the warp. Men mostly work the loom, either singly or with a\ncompanion. But in one case a woman is seen at work at one of the\nupright looms. She is shewn sitting sideways on the low bench and is\nnot pictured in a back view with widely spread legs like the men.\nUnfortunately the work is so slovenly and so much injured that few\nexact outlines can be secured, and hence all detail is insecure.\nThere are also superfluous lines in red colour which confuse the\npicture. The tomb is Ramesside in date (_circa_ 1200 B.C.) The\ninscription over the seated man is too broken to be read."\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 16a.--Weavers at work as represented in the Tomb\nof Nefer-ronpet, Superintendent of Weavers at Thebes.

Date about 1200\nB.C. From a drawing by Mr. N. de G. Davies.]\n\nThe drawings appear to confirm generally what we have gathered from\nMr. Davies\' previous illustration, Fig. 9.\n\n\nPORTIONS OF LOOMS WHICH HAVE COME DOWN TO US.\n\nIn so far as I know, not many loom parts have yet been discovered, and\nthose which I have had an opportunity of studying do not assist us to\nmuch knowledge beyond that which we have gained by a study of the wall\npaintings. We have the article from Kahun already mentioned, which may\npossibly be a warp weight, as it somewhat resembles the later warp\nweights found elsewhere. It is of hardened mud with a perforation at\nthe thin end through which a piece of string has been passed and\nknotted (Fig. 17), but so far no illustration of a loom with weights\nhas been found, either for the period to which this article belongs or\nto any other period. On the other hand the material is not suitable\nfor a net-sinker, nor is it intended to be made to stand up. As\nmentioned above it is probably Ægean.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Piece of perforated hardened mud. Possibly a\nwarp weight, 10 cm. × 8·7 × 4·2 (3-15/16 in. × 2-7/16 in. × 1-5/8 in.)\nWeight 470 gramms (1 lb. 1/2 oz.) Probably of Ægean origin. _Kahun._\nManchester Museum.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Burnt-clay warp weight. Height 11·4 cm. (4-1/4\nin.) Weight 260 gramms (9-1/4 oz.) Probably Roman. Bankfield Museum.\n(Received from Prof. Flinders Petrie).]\n\nAnother form of warp weight, of burnt clay, is somewhat frequently met\nwith, Fig. 18, but it is described as appertaining to Roman times, and\nmay therefore be either a Greek or Roman article. Similar weights from\nCyprus and North Africa, &c., can be seen in the British Museum.\n\nWooden pegs have been found at Gurob, which may possibly have been\nused for holding the warp and breast beams in position, Fig. 19. These\npegs may appear to be rather short for the purpose, but in very\nprimitive looms the warp is not kept so taut as might and should be,\nand hence there is not the same heavy strain on the pegs as we should\ndeem necessary. The way to settle their use would be to fix them in\nsolid ground and test them.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Wooden Peg, possibly used for holding the\nwarp and breast beams. Length 13·5 to 10·2 cm.

But one at least, Fig. 22, has been found with XVIIIth\nto XIXth Dynasty articles at Gurob, that is belonging to the period\n1580-1150 B.C., which is long before Rome existed. None of these\nso-called combs, for they are really embryo reeds, are shown on the\nwall illustrations so that they no doubt belong to a later date than\nthat of the XIIth Dynasty. If, as I take it, these "combs" are the\nforerunners of the reed and were used to drive the weft threads home,\nand if also the Romans had upright looms provided with warp weights\ninstead of the breast beam, then I think the "comb" may not be Roman\nbut may be a late Egyptian invention. For, on trying to use such a\ncomb on a _replica_ of a Scandinavian upright loom provided with warp\nweights (instead of with the breast beam) I can get no good result, in\nfact rather the opposite, but tried on a primitive horizontal loom\nprovided with a breast beam the comb is found to be of some\nassistance, especially if the warp is not very taut as is generally\nthe case with primitive looms. At Bankfield we have an Indian rug\nloom, already referred to, with warp and breast beam on which a\nsomewhat similar instrument, but of iron, was used.[D]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Weaver\'s Comb--a Beater-in. 19·5 cm. × 9·8 ×\n4·2 (7-3/4 in. × 3-7/8 in. × 1-5/8 in.) _Gurob._ Manchester Museum.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.--Possibly a warp spacer, somewhat similar in\nobject to the raddle of modern hand loom weaving.

(Received from Prof. Flinders\nPetrie).]\n\nAn article which Prof. Flinders Petrie describes as a "warp spacer" is\nshown in Fig. 23. From fragments in the Egyptian Collection,\nUniversity College, London, it would appear to have been originally\nmore than a meter (three feet) long. It may have been used as a sort\nof a "raddle," a tool used for assisting to keep the warp threads in\nposition when being beamed, _i.e._ put on to the loom. At Bankfield we\nhave an old local hand loom the warp beam of which is provided with a\nseries of holes in which pegs were once inserted to keep the coloured\nwarp threads in position.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.\n\n1/2 size of end of Fig. 24.\n\n1/2 size section of Fig. 24.\n\nA long piece of perforated wood described by Prof. Flinders Petrie,\n_Kahun_, p. 29, as a Weaver\'s Beam for making rush mats. Length 96·8\ncm. × 8·0 × 3·0 (3 ft. 1-1/4 in. × 3-1/4 in. × 1-3/16 in.) From\nManchester Museum.]\n\nA piece of frame, Fig. 24, has been described as a "weaver\'s beam" for\nmaking rush mats like the modern _hasira_. It is provided with 28\nholes which are arranged about 27 to 40 mm. apart. The holes may have\nbeen more or less circular originally, and worn into present shape by\nthreads, etc., and look more irregular inside than they really are, as\nthe inside surface of the holes is fairly smooth; the holes are\nslightly larger, on an average about 4 mm., on the face shown than on\nthe other face. Prof. Flinders Petrie seems to think it resembles the\nframe on which the modern Egyptian mat is made.\n\nWe now come to the two reeds in the Museum of the Liverpool Institute\nof Archæology, which Dr. John Garstang discovered near Abu Kirkas,\ntomb No. 693, of which he tells us: "They are 27 and 29 inches (68·6\nand 73·7 cm.) in length respectively, and are precisely similar in\ngeneral form. They are constructed on a system of nineteen or twenty\nreeds to the inch, and they may be seen to be exactly similar to the\nmodern reed taken from a loom in the village of Abu Kirkas. It is not\npossible, unfortunately, to assign a precise date to these objects.\nThey were found in a tomb which contained no other remains; this tomb\nwas surrounded by others, all of them likewise very much disturbed,\nbut equally characteristic of the general nature of the Middle Empire\ntombs, and containing nothing but Middle Empire objects. Since, in\ngeneral, few tombs of this site show signs of intrusive burial of a\nlater age, there is no reason to suppose that these objects are of any\ndate later than the XII. Dynasty (_The Burial Customs of Ancient\nEgypt_, London, 1907, pp. 134-136)."\n\nThe horizontal looms we have been describing belong to this period,\nand the artists have not shown any reeds with them. My studies of\nprimitive looms lead me to think that these Egyptian looms are of a\ndate far anterior to the invention or the application of a reed. It\nhas also, I believe, been remarked by those who have examined cloths\nof this date, that the irregular array of the warp threads is good\nproof that reeds could not have been in use. I have already pointed\nout that in the evolution of the loom the reed puts in a late\nappearance, but apart from this fact, I do not think the artist would\nhave omitted such an important tool had it been in use in his time.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.--Reed in Cairo Museum. Length 66 cm. (26 in.)\nIt consists of two wooden frames fitted with flat iron wires. String\nis wound round the frames binding them together. Then a kind of\ncanvas(?) cover in placed over the frames to cover up the projecting\nends of the wires, but this has disappeared in places.]\n\nDr. Garstang points out that although the surrounding tombs contained\nMiddle Empire objects, the reeds were found in a tomb _without_ any\nother remains. This can hardly be considered evidence tending to prove\nthat they belonged to the period named, and it is certainly weakened\nby the accompanying statement that the reeds are _exactly_ similar to\nthe modern reed, for that is almost sufficient to prove that they are\n_not_ 3900-3700 years old. To me they seem comparatively modern and\nvery similar to one in the Cairo Museum which MM. Brugsch and Quibell\nare inclined to think is Coptic with this difference, that in Dr.\nGarstang\'s reeds the divisions appear to be of cane or wood, while in\nthe Cairo reed they are of iron (?steel). The sketch of this Coptic\nreed, Fig. 25, has been drawn specially for me, and Miss W. M.\nCrompton, Assistant Keeper in Egyptology in the Manchester University\nMuseum, has kindly examined the sketch with the article and pronounced\nit correct. We may, I think, safely conclude that the reed found by\nDr. Garstang is Coptic and not Ancient Egyptian.\n\nAs regards the actual work of weaving, balls of thread have been found\nand so have very flat bobbins and pieces of stick with thread wound\nround which may have been spools as indicated in the drawing, Fig. 7.\nThere is no reason why balls of thread should not have been used as\nthey are in uncivilised countries at the present day, as, for\ninstance, in Tibet, as reported by W. W. Rockhill in _Diary of a\nJourney through Mongolia and Thibet_, Washington, 1894, p. 41.\n\n\n"DIAGONAL WEAVING."\n\nI am unable to agree with a recently made statement published in _The\nLabyrinth, Gerzeh and Marghuneh_, by Prof. Flinders Petrie, E. A.\nWainwright and E. Mackey, p. 6, which runs: "The fact of the weft not\nbeing at right angles to the warp, if one may conclude by the fabrics,\ndoes not, I think, imply that such weaving is of inferior quality.\nWhen I noticed the peculiarity first, I thought it might have arisen\nthrough distortion by stretching over the body, but repeated examples\nof the same fact have led me to consider other causes. We know how\nclosely analogous to \'darning\' was the early weaving; and in our days\nit is not unusual to find stockings not darned at right angles, and it\nmay be the women weavers of old sometimes put in the weft more or less\nout of true right angle. In the childhood of weaving we should expect\ndifferent methods, and it may be, seeing that we have no selvedged\ncloth until very long after this time, that they experimented with a\ndiagonal weft to see if it would not reduce the tendency to fray out\nat the sides." The amount the warp and weft are out of the right angle\nis stated to be about 20°. The specimen shown me under the microscope\nindicated clearly that the warp and weft were not at right angles and\nthat the interstices were not square but diamond shaped.\n\nIt is possible to arrange the warp threads diagonally from beam to\nbeam, but with continuous weft (that is in weaving so as to get\nselvedges) the weft has the tendency to slip up on one side and down\non the other, hence the weaving is made laborious. With a separate\nweft for each pick, _i.e._, for every once the shed is opened, there\nis naturally not this tendency, but this alleged diagonally woven\ncloth frays just as easily as any other piece of cloth without\nselvedge, so in either case there is not only no advantage but\ndistinct disadvantage taking the diagonal "beaming" into\nconsideration. We must give the Egyptians credit for using the least\nlaborious of two methods, that is _if_ the second one were known to\nthem.\n\nApparent diagonal weaving can be produced by anyone taking an ordinary\npiece of linen or cotton cloth, cutting off the selvedge and\nstretching the cloth in a direction diagonally to the direction of the\nwarp and weft, and a piece of diagonally woven cloth is the result!\n\nThe probability is that the specimen of cloth, without a selvedge,\nhaving been stretched over the body for a long period of time, has, in\nthe course of that time lost its nature and when removed it has\nretained its altered form and gives us the impression of having been\nwoven diagonally.\n\n\n"THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III."\n\nIn the foregoing I have shown how extremely simple was the whole\napparatus for weaving in use by the Ancient Egyptians, and one is\nrather surprised to be told that about B.C. 1200, in the time of\nRameses III., the Egyptians "built and used looms very much more\ncomplicated than has hitherto been believed to be the case," or to be\nreferred to "the really complicated form of loom used." Yet this is\nwhat Mr. Thorold D. Lee tells us (pp. 84 and 86) in his paper on _The\nLinen Girdle of Rameses III._ (_Ann. of Archæology and Anthropology of\nthe Liverpool Institute of Archæology_, July, 1912, V.)\n\nThe characteristics of this girdle are its great length, 17 feet (5 m.\n2), its even taper diminishing from 5 in. (12·7 cm.) in width to 1-7/8\nin. (4·8 cm.) in width, its elaborate design and excellent\nworkmanship. Perhaps the chief of these characteristics is the taper.\nIt is most probable, as Mr. Lee points out, that in the weaving the\nwarp threads have been gradually dropped out to make the taper, rather\nthan that additional warp threads have been added. As it is easy to\ndrop a warp thread, and almost impossible to add one while weaving is\nin progress, Mr. Lee\'s view is confirmed by this. It would also be\nalmost impossible to keep the warp taut if the number of warp threads\nwere increased as the work went on. This means that the girdle was\ncommenced at the wide end and finished at the narrow end.\n\nIt is common knowledge that when a warp thread drops out, its place is\nindicated by a thinness or fine opening for the whole length of the\nmissing warp, and this is so because the reed, besides pushing the\nweft into position, also acts as a warp spacer, that is to say it\nkeeps the warp threads properly apart, every one being properly\naligned. When no reed is used the warp threads are not so evenly\nplaced--they are not so parallel to one another for there is nothing\nbut their tautness to keep them in position. Hence there is every\nreason to conclude that when, on a loom provided with a reed, warp\nthreads have been removed their position must be indicated, and _vice\nversa_ if no reed has been used the position of the removed threads\nwill not be so clearly indicated, but there will be a more marked\nshrinkage in the width of the cloth as well as in the pattern, and\nthis is what has taken place in the girdle giving us the diminishing\ntaper.\n\n[Illustration: "THE LINEN GIRDLE OF RAMESES III."\n\n_Reproduced by kind permission of Dr. Clubb, Director, The Museums,\nLiverpool._]\n\nIf this diminishing taper were indicated by a decrease in the width of\nthe pattern commencing at the selvedges, then it might be presumed\nthat a reed had been used for the central portion only--a very clumsy\neven if feasible arrangement, but the pattern begins to decrease along\nthe middle and hence no reed could have been used.\n\nIt does not follow that because a loom was not provided with a reed it\nwas without heddles. Anyone who will examine the large series of\nprimitive looms at Bankfield Museum, will observe that heddles\npreceded reeds; this must necessarily be so as the making of the shed\nis the first step in weaving, while the reed\'s work is more that of a\nfinisher. But the heddles are all extremely primitive, and in my\nexperience do not exceed four in number where there is no reed. Such a\nquantity of heddles with its complicated harness as Mr. Lee considers\nnecessary is quite out of the question with a loom so undeveloped as\nnot to be provided with a reed. Hence the indication is that the\ngirdle was woven on a loom of a primitive character.\n\nIn carrying out the work the weaver has made many mistakes. On the\nleft hand side of the right hand row of red crosses (they come out\nblack in the photograph) there is an "end down" for a considerable\ndistance--that is a thread has been missed.\n\nOn the same row of crosses three white threads show above and below,\nwhile on the left hand row of crosses there are five white threads\nabove and below. The crosses are neither the same size nor shape in\nthe two columns and curiously their white hafts in both columns point\nto the left instead of one row pointing to the left and the other to\nthe right. Then again the white point at the right apex of the zigzag\non the left corresponds to a red point at the left apex of the right\nhand zigzag, but if the girdle had been woven on an advanced loom with\ndobby and harness these points would have been red in both places.\n\nAs regards the large number of warp threads to the inch which Mr. Lee\nputs down as 272-340 (107-134 per cm.), this does not by any means\nindicate a complicated piece of machinery for the weaving of this belt\nor any other fabric. The greater the number of threads to the inch the\nfiner must the threads be in order to get them into the allotted\nspace, and in the weaving there will be so many more threads to raise\nand lower in order to make the shed opening. It means multiplying the\nwork but does not necessarily mean that a more complicated loom must\nbe used in the weaving.\n\nIt is not possible without opening the fabric to be quite positive on\nthe many points which are raised, but there seems nothing about it\nwhich should prevent its having been made on a simple loom. Although\nsuperior to most, but not all, of the well known Coptic cloths in\nBankfield and in many other museums, it very closely resembles some of\nthem in many respects excepting in the taper.\n\nI should add that in making my examination of this girdle I was kindly\nassisted by Mr. C. A. Trigg, a well known Halifax mill manager and\ndesigner. We made the examination independently and on comparing notes\nafterwards found that we agreed in all essential points.\n\n\nAN EXAMINATION OF FIFTEEN SPECIMENS OF MUMMY WRAPPINGS.\n\nBy W. W. MIDGLEY, Curator, retired, The Museums, Bolton.\n\n"So far back as 1834, Mummy cloths occupied the attention of James\nThompson, F.R.S., who, after researches into their characteristics and\nstructure wrote a paper on the subject, which appears in the London\nand Edinburgh Philosophical Magazine, Vol. V., page 355. From that\ntime until quite recently, little additional knowledge on the subject\nhas appeared. In the early part of 1910, Prof. W. M. Flinders Petrie,\nF.R.S., expressed a desire that the writer should undertake\nmicroscopic investigation of the body-wrappings of cloths of the III.\nand early IV. Dynasties (_circa_ 2980-2750 B.C.) which he had brought\nhome from excavations made at a cemetery near Meydum, Upper Egypt. The\nreport upon them forms part of the "_Historical Studies_," Vol. II.,\nof the _British School of Archæology in Egypt_.\n\nWhen Mr. Ling Roth suggested that some of the examples of Egyptian\nMummy cloths in Bankfield Museum should be examined on similar lines,\ndescribing the construction of the fabrics and yarns, together with\nthe characteristics of the fibres used, I undertook to carry out the\nwork and forward to him the results for permanent reference.\n\nEach of the fifteen cloths submitted was first examined by mounting\nabout 3/4" × 5/8" (20 mm. × 16 mm.) of the cloth on 3" × 1" (76 mm. ×\n25 mm.) glass slips, and covering with thin glass, so as to find out\nits plan of composition and the number of warp and weft threads per\nlinear inch. Afterwards, a little of the warp threads as well as of\nthe weft, was untwisted and the fibres separated, and these mounted\napart on another 3" × 1" slip (76 × 25 mm.), so that the kind of\ntextile fibre used and the diameter of the fibres could be measured.\nThese microscopical preparations will be kept in Bankfield Museum, as\nthey may be of interest to microscopists in the locality.\n\nThe cloths are from three sources:--Nos. 1 and 2 being from the\nprivate collection of Dr. Wallis-Budge, who has given the specimens to\nBankfield Museum; Nos. 3 to 8 are from the old Meyer collection in the\nLiverpool Museum (unfortunately the origin of them is unknown); and\nthose marked 9 to 15 were taken from a mummy of the XXVI. Dynasty,\nbrought to this country by Lord Denbigh, and now also in the Liverpool\nMuseum.\n\nA.--Specimens of Mummy cloths from Theban Tombs date about B.C. 1400,\npresented by Dr. Wallis-Budge.\n\n    1.

The warp has about half its strands\n    doubled (that is twined together), whereas the weft has\n    only about one in twenty doubled. See Fig. 26.\n\n    2. This is a coarser fabric, has been dyed with\n    saffron, and is somewhat brittle to tease out the\n    fibres. Both these cloths had evidently absorbed some of\n    the gums or balsams used in the process of embalming,\n    and hence the difficulty of separating the fibres for\n    identification is increased. The structure of the fabric\n    is peculiar, and, indeed, the only instance I have seen\n    in Egyptian cloths. A portion, near the middle of the\n    piece sent, has the warp strands in pairs parallel to\n    each other, a few of them being double yarns, while all\n    the remainder are doubled. Of the weft, nearly half are\n    double yarns. See Fig. 27.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.--Magnified 10 diameters.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.--Magnified 10 diameters, showing the warp yarn\nin pairs.]\n\nB.--Specimens from the Meyer Collection, marked No. 11088. (Date of\nacquisition about 1856; date and place of origin unknown).\n\n    3. This is a beautifully soft, fine _Wool_ fabric,\n    containing no size or balsam. From the fineness of the\n    yarn and of the individual fibres I have no doubt that\n    the wool has been imported from India, or, more likely,\n    that the cloth was made in Cashmere. The texture is a\n    plain weave, has a selvedge edge, the warp yarns are\n    doubled, while the weft is single yarn. It is much to be\n    regretted that the particulars of locality, of burial,\n    and the period of time to which this interesting fabric\n    belongs has been lost. I assume from the general\n    characteristics that it is of a late period--probably\n    not earlier than the Ptolemaic.\n\n    4. This linen cloth has a plain selvedge, regular weave,\n    and contains no size. About 25% of both warp and weft\n    yarns are doubled, and all are very even in diameter.\n\n    5. A coarse linen cloth with plain selvedge. All the\n    yarns are single and even in diameter.\n\n    6. This is a coarse, highly-sized linen cloth. The yarns\n    are agglutinated, are brittle, and it is difficult to\n    separate the fibres. The sample submitted has been cut\n    from the end of the piece and shows the warp ends.\n\n    7. A coarse linen cloth, sized and brittle. No selvedge\n    on the piece sent. Both warp and weft yarns are single,\n    and even in diameter.\n\n    8. This is a very coarse linen fabric heavily sized and\n    brittle. Both warp and weft yarns are single and very\n    irregular in diameter.\n\nC.--Lord Denbigh\'s: XXVI. Dynasty.\n\n    9. A soft-spun linen cloth containing no size. Specimen\n    has been cut from the body of the fabric, showing no\n    selvedge. About half of the warp is composed of doubled\n    yarns of irregular diameter; the weft is of doubled\n    yarns and more regular in diameter.\n\n    10. The selvedge of this linen fabric is peculiar and\n    somewhat elaborate. The outer margin is composed of four\n    sets of ten yarns parallel to each other, forming one\n    strand of warp; then comes a space of 1-9/10" (48 mm.)\n    where the warp yarns are dyed red; then occurs three\n    more sets of ten parallel yarns (the object being to\n    strengthen the selvedge), followed by the general body\n    of the fabric. The entire selvedge is 2-1/4" (57 mm.)\n    wide. About half the warp yarns are doubled, while all\n    the weft are composed of doubled yarns, both being\n    fairly even in diameter, and not sized.\n\n    11. A fine, soft, linen cloth, with selvedge 1-1/8" (29\n    mm.) wide; the three outer and the two inner strands of\n    the warp are made up of many parallel yarns, as in No.\n    10, with an interspace of 3/8" (10 mm.) All the warp\n    yarns are dyed red, about 25% of them being doubled; the\n    weft is peculiar in having five or six strands of single\n    yarns alternating with six or seven double yarns, giving\n    a faint stripe in the fabric.\n\n    12. A linen cloth, with no selvedge edge. It has been\n    dyed red, probably _ferum_, a dye which I find uniformly\n    associated with friable or decomposing fibres.\n\n    13. A peculiarly coloured fine linen cloth; the pattern\n    is caused by some of the warp yarns being dyed, and\n    occurring sometimes of four, two, or one red strands,\n    with grey ones intermixed. A few of the warp yarns are\n    doubled. The weft is composed of single yarns and are\n    all in the grey.\n\n    14. A coarse soft-woven linen fabric, containing no\n    size. Lines are indicated at irregular distances along\n    the cloth, varying from 5/16" to 9/16" (8 to 14 mm.);\n    these are caused by the introduction of three strands of\n    doubled yarn in the warp while the remainder are single\n    yarns. The weft is all of doubled yarns; both warp and\n    weft are very regular in diameter.\n\n    15. This is a variegated linen fabric with warps\n    coloured something like No. 13, but the red strands of\n    warp are more irregular in distribution. Like it, a few\n    of the warp yarns are doubled, both the red and the\n    grey; while the weft is all of single yarns and in the\n    grey."\n\n[A considerable quantity of specimens of the cloths which were woven\nby the Ancient Egyptians has been examined both in this country and\nabroad.

MSS. No. 29823, Fol. 32.\n\n[D] Olafsson, to be referred to later on, remarks that while in Ovid\'s\ntime the _spathe_ was used for beating-in the weft, in Seneca\'s time\nthe weft was beaten in by a toothed instrument. In other words a\nweaver\'s comb--the embryo reed--had been introduced.\n\n\n\n\nII. THE GREEK LOOM.\n\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.--A Bushongo weaver at work. From Torday and\nJoyce, _Notes Ethnographiques_, _Ann. du Congo_, p. 182.]\n\nWe have now to say a few words about an upright loom which differs\nvery materially from the Egyptian loom already described. Whether the\nhorizontal loom is a later product than the vertical loom, or was\nevolved from it, or whether both were independent inventions cannot be\ndiscussed here, but I may point out that there is an intermediate form\nbetween the two. It is doubtful as to whether this is a transition\nform. It was first brought to my notice by Mr. T. A. Joyce, as in use\namongst some negro peoples in Central Africa possessing an old, high\nand possibly introduced civilisation, and is figured in Messrs. Torday\nand Joyce\'s Notes _Ethnographiques ... Bakuba ... et Bushongo_\n(_Annales du Congo_) pp. 24 and 182. In this loom the warp is\nstretched between an upper beam and a lower beam at an angle of about\n90 degrees, and the weaver sits underneath at his work, Fig. 28. It is\nnot at all uncommon to meet with illustrations showing the warp\nstretched at an incline, and apart from the fact that in many the\nweavers are posing for illustration, and therefore, are most probably\nnot exactly in their natural positions, the tilted arrangement has\nthis advantage, namely, that the work of beating-in is improved by\nthe fall given to the "sword" which, with less exertion by the\nweaver, drives the weft home more effectively. In all these cases,\nhowever, the weaver sits or stands in front of the loom, but in the\ncase of the Bushongo the loom is tilted to such an extent that the\nweaver finds it more convenient to sit underneath the warp.\n\nThe discovery by Messrs. Alan Gardiner and N. de G. Davies of\nillustrations of Egyptian upright looms, confirms Wilkinson in his\nstatement and illustration that the Egyptians had this class of loom\nas well as the horizontal one. The vertical loom is found in Europe,\nAsia, Africa and America, and is, probably, ethnically as old if not\nolder than the horizontal loom.[E] But this Egyptian upright loom\ndiffers from another, the Greek, or Central European, or Scandinavian\nform of the upright loom, in having an upper and a lower beam so that\nthe warp is made taut between two beams, while in the Greek loom there\nis only _one_ beam. The warp hangs from this beam, the warp threads\nbeing made taut by means of weights attached at the lower ends.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 29a.--Illustration on a small lekythos of an\nAthenian girl at work on a tapestry loom, together with a full size\ntracing of the tapestry loom. British Museum. B.C. 500.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 29b.--Illustration of a Greek woman with a\ntapestry loom. From Stackelberg\'s _Graeber der Hellenen_, pl. xxxiii.]\n\nThe Greeks were, however, acquainted with the tapestry loom, for there\nexists in the British Museum a small lekythos with an illustration,\nFig. 29a, of such an article resting on the knees of a lady weaver.[F]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 30.--Greek woman at work on a loom. From C. Robert\nἘφ ἀρχ 1892, pl. xiii., p. 247. It is not possible to say from\nthis illustration whether this is a warp weighted loom or not.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 31.--Penelope at her loom. Illustration on an\nAthenian skyphos found in an Etruscan tomb at Chiusi, and at present\nin the museum there. The illustration is taken from _Monumenti d.\nInst. Archeologico_, IX., pl. xlii.]\n\nIt has been described by Mr. H. B. Walters in _Jour. Hellenic\nStudies_, XXXI., 1911, p. 15, who says: "In front of her, Fig. 29a, is\na white wool basket (_Kalathos_) and on her lap is a frame somewhat in\nthe form of a lyre, being formed by two upright pieces with knobs at\nthe top, diverging slightly towards the top, across between which are\nstretched two threads at the top and two at the bottom, seven vertical\nthreads being also visible. Her hands are placed on the threads, which\nshe is engaged in manipulating. This object can only be intended for a\nhand loom, though there is apparently no evidence for the use of such\nobjects in ancient times or among Oriental races either in the past or\nthe present day. The only other parallel to the representation on this\nvase is one published by Stackelberg, Fig. 29b, where a woman holds a\nsimilar frame and is similarly occupied with her hands. The writers of\nthe articles _Sticken_ in Baumeister and _Phrygium Opus_ in Daremberg\nand Saglio, misled by the likeness of the object to the modern\ncrewel-frame, interpret the process as embroidery. But this kind of\nwork implies cloth or other textile substance already woven, on which\npatterns are worked in, whereas in both vase paintings the textile is\nobviously in course of construction." He is right in so far as he\ngoes, but both representations are those of _tapestry_ looms which\nfact is indicated by the warp threads in both cases, and by the design\nmarked on the warp threads of Fig. 29b--a method of preparing their\nwork in use to this day by tapestry weavers. Some authorities consider\nthat tapestry weaving is more closely related to mat making than to\ntrue weaving. In other words, I take it tapestry is an early stage in\nthe development of weaving. From this we get some idea as to how far\nthe Greeks had progressed in the textile arts.\n\nAs pointed out by MM. Daremberg and Saglio, _Dic. des Antiquités\nGrecques et Romaines_ pt. 46, p. 164, "illustrations of Greek or Roman\nmethods of weaving are very rare, they are much reduced and in so far\nas the art is concerned purely diagrammatic." On the other hand if\nthere are numerous references in the texts of classic authors, these\nreferences seem rather to obscure than elucidate the method of\nworking. However, there are three illustrations--the Penelope loom,\nFig. 31, and two Boeotian looms, one of which is illustrated in Fig.\n15--quite sufficient to explain the principle of the upright loom as\nused with warp weights by the Greeks, and the discovery of numerous\narticles, considered to be the warp weights, confirm the illustration.\n\nThe principle is the same throughout, viz.: the looms are vertical,\nthere is a warp beam on top, there are two cross rods one of which is\na laze rod and _possibly_ the other is a heddle; and the warp threads\nare all kept taut by means of attached weights. On one of the Boeotian\nlooms a bobbin or spool is shown. Along the top of Penelope\'s loom\nthere are indications of nine pegs, on six of which balls of coloured\nthread have been placed, evidently for working out the designs, very\nmuch the same as shown on the rug loom in Bankfield Museum already\nreferred to. The warp weights on this Athenian illustration are\ntriangular in shape, and perhaps resemble the pyramidic weights found\nin Egypt and attributed to Roman times. Assuming these pyramids are\nRoman warp weights it would appear that both Greeks and Romans had\nvertical looms on which the warp threads were kept taut by means of\nweights. In one of the few clearly expressed technical classical\nreferences, Seneca speaks of the warp threads stretched by hanging\nweights.\n\nIn the above classical illustrations which are after all only rough\ndiagrams, the warp weights appear to hang from a _single_ thread only,\nbut this can not have been correct. The warp threads must have been\nbunched, because a single suspended thread with a tension weight\nimmediately begins to unravel, and so loses the advantage of its\nhaving been spun, as any one can ascertain for oneself. As regards the\nsame point on the Lake Dwellers looms, Cohausen was the first to\nsurmise that the warp threads were bunched to receive the weight, and\nMessikommer proved it by practical experiment.[G]\n\nAs can be surmised with this class of loom the weaving begins at the\n_top_, working _down_wards, and the beating-in of the weft is\n_up_wards--the exact opposite to the method adopted with other\nlooms--for the pendant warp ends, although weighted to keep them taut,\ndo not appear to have been further fixed in position, so that to\ncommence weaving at the lower end made the operation so extremely\ndifficult as to be almost impossible.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 32.--Illustration of a Scandinavian warp weighted\nloom in the Copenhagen Museum. The illustration is taken from\nMontelius\' _Civilisation of Sweden in Heathen Times_, translated by\nthe Rev. F. H. Woods, London, Macmillan & Co., 1888, p. 160.\n\n[In the illustration of this loom published by the Trustees of the\nBritish Museum, in their _Guide to the Antiquities of the Early Iron\nAge_, London, 1905, p. 139, the shape of the warp weights has been\naltered to suit the shape of such weights in the British Museum\ncollections.]]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 33.--Icelandic Loom after Olafsson.\n\n_a a_ Beam on which the warp is fixed. _b b_ Weights to make the warp\ntaut. _c c_ Brackets which support the beam and on which it can be\nrevolved by means of the spoke _e_ when the warp has to be lengthened,\non account of the weft _f_ working downwards and so shortening the\nfinished portion of the woven cloth. _g_ A sharp bone or tough piece\nof wood to beat the weft into proper position. _h_ The wound up weft\nwhich is pushed through the warp with the fingers. _i i_ The unbeamed\nwarp. _k k_ The heddles or shed openers. _l l_ The supports on which\nthe heddles rest when the "pick" is made [_i.e._, the pushing the weft\nthrough]. _m_ The beater-in. _n_ and _o_ Laze rods. _q_ The template\nfor regulating the width of the cloth. _r r_ and _s s_ Beam on to\nwhich the loom is fixed.\n\nSome of the descriptions are not as clear as could be wished. It is\nprobable that _g_ is a preliminary to _m_. N. Annandale mentions that\nhe obtained in the Faroes a beater-in made of a whale\'s jaw or rib;\nwhile in Iceland he saw some of the perforated stones to which the\nwarp threads were attached (_The Faroes and Iceland_, Oxford, 1905,\npp. 195-6).]\n\nThe Scandinavian form of the "Greek" loom from the Faroes Fig. 32, is\nmade known to us through the article itself in the Copenhagen Museum,\nillustrated by Montelius, _Civilisation of Sweden in Heathen Times_,\nLond. 1888, p. 160, and through the very clear illustration and\ndescription given us by Olafsson in his _Oeconomische Reise durch\nIsland_, 1787, translated from the Danish edition of 1780. The loom\nfigured by Olafsson, Fig. 33, shows an advance on that of Montelius,\nin being provided with heddles.[H] Upright looms with a lower beam\ninstead of with warp weights and furnished with heddles, are not\nuncommon. There are the well known Indian and Persian rug looms, and\nDu Chaillu figures one in his _Journey to Ashango Land_, London, 1867,\nplate facing p. 291. Randall-Maciver and Wilkin illustrate a vertical\nloom in use among the Kabyles, _Libyan Notes_, London, 1901, Pl. IX.,\nand although the details of the illustration are not clear the text\nindicates the existence of one heddle: "The warp is decussated by\nmeans of a horizontal rod and leashes." Dr. Washington Mathews figures\nseveral Navajo looms with heddles, _Third Ann. Rep. Bureau of\nEthnology_, p. 291; Ancient Peruvians also used them, as shown by Dr.\nMax Schmidt, _Baessler Archiv, I. pt. 1_, and so on practically _ad.\nlib._ But to work an upright warp-weighted loom with heddles is\nattended with great practical inconvenience, and this difficulty has,\nno doubt, been one of the chief causes of the complete discardance of\nthis class of loom.\n\nIn spite of the evidence in favour of the existence of warp weighted\nlooms, the Director of the Hermannstadt Museum, Dr. v.\nKimakovicz-Winnicki, sees fit to deny their existence. He found that\nin some parts of Transylvania the peasants use wooden pyramids (see\nFig. 18) similar to the Roman warp weights for winding the thread\nfrom the spindle on to the shuttle. For this purpose sockets are\nbored into the thin or top end of two pyramids, which are placed\njust so far apart that a spindle can rest horizontally with one end\nin the socket of one pyramid, and the other end of the spindle in\nthe socket of the other pyramid, and the thread in being wound off\non to the shuttle causes the spindle to revolve in the sockets. From\nthis he argues that what we have hitherto taken to be warp weights\nare not warp weights at all (_Spinn-u. Webewerkzeuge_, Wuerzburg,\n1911), and having denied these articles to be warp weights he gets\nover the difficulty presented by the illustration of Penelope at her\nloom, by attempting to prove that what we take to be a loom is no\nloom at all but a _flechtrahm_, _i.e._ plaiting frame! He then\nattempts to pull to pieces the idea that the Scandinavian loom in\nthe Copenhagen Museum is a loom and condemns it as unworkable. There\ncan be no doubt about his meaning as he defines his terms. The\nprinciple of weaving (_Weben_) he describes "as the absorption of\ntwo groups of parallel material elements (warp and weft) at right\nangles to each other, and the principle of plaiting (_Flechten_) as\nthe absorption by itself in one plane of one group only of material\nelement, (warp)" and he gives diagrammatic illustrations showing\nclearly what he means (_op. cit._ p. 31).[I] Judging from his\nremarks one must conclude he has not seen a primitive loom of any\nsort, and were it not for the official position he holds, his\nremarks would not need answering.\n\nIt has, I believe, been suggested more than once that some of the\nperforated stones, pieces of burnt clay, pieces of chalk and like\nobjects may be and are net-sinkers, and there is some justification\nfor Dr. Kimakovicz-Winnicki\'s statement that the pyramidic forms are\nnot warp weights; but it does not follow that all the perforated\narticles are either spindle-holders or net-sinkers, yet that is what\nhis subsequent statements lead one to infer. It is, however, difficult\nto prove that these perforated articles are warp weights.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 34.--Side view and section of chalk warp weight\nfound at Great Driffield. Of three of the weights the following\ndimensions were taken:\n\n    7-3/4" (19·7 cm.) long,   2 lbs. 3 oz. (1·0 k)\n    6"     (15·2  " )   "     1 lb.  8 oz.

Found with eighteen more in the _filling_ of\npit 7, Winkelbury Hill." _Excavations in Winkelbury Camp_, by\nLieut.-Gen. Pitt-Rivers (_Excavations in Cranbourne Chase_, Vol. II.,\n1888). As Pitt-Rivers also found at Winkelbury the fragment of a comb\nand a chalk spindle whorl, which are textile tools, we may safely\npresume these fashioned pieces of chalk are warp weights.]\n\nIn 1875 several flat irregular oblong perforated pieces of soft chalk\nwere found in enlarging the cattle market in Great Driffield,\nYorkshire; they were found in a hole about three feet deep with\nAnglo-Saxon potsherds, animal remains, and bits of iron. They can now\nbe seen in the Mortimer Collection in the Hull Museum. They consist of\npieces of chalk, similar to those which drop annually in thousands\nupon thousands down the cliffs from the boulder clay between\nBridlington and Flamborough. On some a shoulder has been cut, Fig. 34,\nmost have one perforation, but in a few specimens, where the thin\nportion above the hole has been broken off, a second hole has been\nmade. None of them can stand unsupported. Owing to the soluble nature\nof the chalk they could not have been used as net-sinkers in the sea\n(about nine miles off) for they would quickly dissolve in salt water,\nand the same holds good in regard to fresh water, although in a lesser\ndegree. But I do not think they were used even in fresh water as\nnet-sinkers, for it was a characteristic of primitive peoples, with\nwhom time was of no account, to do their work thoroughly--what they\nmade was intended to last, and chalk net-sinkers would not have\nlasted. That these were found in a limited quantity, I believe about\nseventeen in number, tends to show that they are warp weights, for\nonly a few are required for every loom, in spite of the considerable\nnumber shown in the non-technical illustration of Penelope\'s loom. Not\nbeing able to find any other use for these pieces of chalk, and\njudging that they are suitable for the purpose, I should say they are\nwarp weights. In this case the weaver has made the most of what nature\nhas given him; in other parts of England he has had to fashion the\nweight out of the rough chalk, Fig. 35.\n\nIn the Museum at Devizes there are several hard pieces of perforated\nand fashioned chalk which offer more conclusive evidence. Of these\nMrs. M. E. Cunnington, the Curator, writes me: "All the weights here\nhave holes bored right through. Two large ones stand easily on the\nfloor. Others are more irregular in form and will not stand upright.\nThis latter type is, as far as I am aware, the more usual in this part\nof the country. They are commonly cut out of the hard chalk, and weigh\nabout 3 or 4 lbs. (1·5-2 Kilos). We think these weights are loom\nweights because we find them with Romano-British remains, as at\nWestbury, and late Celtic remains on our chalk uplands, far from water\nwhere fishing could have been carried on. With the same remains we\nfind weaving combs, numerous spindle whorls and other tools of bone\nthat were also probably used in weaving operations." The Westbury, in\nWiltshire, referred to, is some thirty miles in a straight line from\nthe mouth of the Severn, and about forty miles from the English\nChannel. These pieces of chalk cannot therefore have been used as\nnet-sinkers, leaving out of consideration their composition; they were\nfound with weaving tools and they fit the position. So far the\ningenuity of our ablest archæologists at home and abroad has not\nsucceeded in ascribing the use of these objects to anything else than\nnet-sinking or warp tension. The adaptability of the articles for use\nas warp weights, the small groups in which they are found, the\ndiscovery of weaving implements in the closest proximity, our\nknowledge of the Greek representations of warp-weighted looms, the\nOlafsson illustration, and the loom in the Copenhagen Museum all tend\nto prove that these articles are really warp weights.\n\nAs regards the practical possibility or impossibility of working a\n"Greek" loom, I had a simple frame made in the Museum and showed Mr.\nJ. Smith, a mill "Overlooker" at Messrs. Wayman and Sons, Ld.,\nHalifax, the illustration in Montelius\' book already referred to, and\nasked him to weave me a small piece of cloth on it. In the course of a\nfew hours he did the warping, beaming and weaving, making the pick\nwith his fingers and using a ball of weft thread instead of a spool or\nshuttle. The result is shown in the accompanying illustration, Fig.\n36, conclusively proving that weaving on such a frame is quite\nfeasible, and practically proving that Olafsson\'s and the Copenhagen\nwarp weighted looms are properly constructed workable looms.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 36.--A warp weighted loom made at Bankfield\nMuseum, to show the possibility of weaving by this method. There is no\nheddle nor shuttle used. The weaver made the "shed" and pushed the\nweft through with his fingers. He naturally worked _down_wards.]\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 37.--Diagram to show how the warp is kept taut on\na Syrian loom.]\n\nFinally, it may not be out of place here to point out that there are\nother looms, besides the Greek and Scandinavian, on which the warp is\nmade taut by means of warp weights. The Rev. Dr. Harvey Porter, of the\nAmerican College, Beyrout, Syria, writing about the year 1901, thus\ndescribes the common loom of the country. He says: "Two upright posts\nare fixed in the ground, which hold the roller to which the threads of\nthe warp are fastened, and upon which the cloth is wound as it is\nwoven. The threads of the warp are carried upward towards the ceiling\nat the other end of the room, and pass over rollers, and are gathered\nin hanks and weighted to keep them taut (_Dic. of the Bible_,\nEdinburgh, 1902, IV., p. 901)." He has kindly sent me an illustration\nof this loom, but unfortunately the weights are not clearly shown, and\nthe same is the case with an illustration of a loom from Cyprus.[J]\nThe diagram, Fig. 37, shows the principle. In a Shan loom illustrated\nby Mrs. Leslie Milne, in _The Shans at Home_, London, 1910, p. 120,\nthe warp makes a somewhat similar detour over the head of the weaver,\nit is, however, not weighted but tied to a beam. The point to be\nobserved is that these warp-weighted looms are horizontal and not\nperpendicular, and also that the weaving is the reverse of that on the\nGreek loom but similar to that on our horizontal looms, so that the\npresent Syrian and Cyprian looms have nothing in common with the old\nGreek loom.\n\n[Illustration: Fig. 38.--Hand of Penelope clutching her shuttle. From\na corner of a piece of sculpture discovered by O. Kern and described\nby C. Robert, (_The Feet Washing of Odysseus_, fifth Century B.C.,\n_Mitt. Kais. Deutsch. Arch. Inst._, Athens, XXV., 1900, pp. 332-3).\nThe author considers Penelope to be in the act of unravelling what she\nhas woven: "We see her holding the spool with her right hand, while\nthe left hand, half closed, is raised to about shoulder high, and the\nfingers, if I read the traces correctly, are posed as though she held\na thread."]\n\nThe Greeks evidently used a spool in weaving, that is a piece of stick\nround which was wound the thread that became the weft, as is shown in\nthe hand of Penelope, Fig. 38, and in Kirke\'s loom, Fig. 15.\n\n\nFOOTNOTES:\n\n[E] I find frequent references, by various writers, to an upright loom\nmentioned by E. H. Palmer as used by a Bedawin woman near Jebel Musa,\nbut on looking up his description (_The Desert of the Exodus_, I. p.\n125), I find it to be so indifferent as to be quite useless for\npurposes of comparison.\n\n[F] My attention to this was kindly drawn by Mr. F. N. Pryce,\nAssistant in the Dept. of Greek and Roman Antiquities.\n\n[G] The existence of warp weighted looms amongst the prehistoric Lake\nDwellers of Switzerland was first surmised by Pauer (_Keller\'s Lake\nDwellings_) from the discovery of the weights, and was made\npractically certain by Messikommer and Jentsch.\n\n[H] Comparing the loom Olafsson saw with the description in the Nial\nSaga, he concludes this sort of loom was in use A.D. 1014, in the\nNorth of Scotland.\n\n[I] He criticises the detail of the illustration of Penelope\'s loom.\nIt must be remembered this illustration is not a technical drawing,\nbut an artist\'s representation where correctness of detail cannot be\nexpected. In his own drawing of the Egyptian horizontal loom many of\nthe warp threads are shown over instead of under the laze rods, and\nyet this is supposed to be a correct technical drawing!\n\n[J] Since writing Dr. Porter has sent me photograph of another sort of\nloom in which weights are used as counter balances to keep the heddles\nraised. The subject requires further elucidation.\n\n\n\n\nIII. CONCLUSION.\n\n\nFrom the foregoing we gather that the Ancient Egyptians had two forms\nof looms. The earlier or horizontal form, date about B.C. 2000, has in\na modified way survived to the present day in desert Egypt and is also\nfound in Seistan. It required a large area of ground for working and\nprobably in earlier times when there was plenty of space this did not\nmuch matter. But as the population in the towns increased and with\nthe increase of civilisation and its concomitant increased demand for\ncloth, probably out of proportion to the increase of population, space\nwould be begrudged and this may have caused the invention or the\nintroduction of the vertical form of loom which we find in use some\n500 years later. In Egypt therefore the horizontal loom preceded the\nvertical loom but it does not necessarily follow that such was the\ncase elsewhere. In so far as we can gather from the small amount of\ninformation at our disposal, in the earlier days the women were the\nweavers, and later on with the introduction of the upright loom the\nmen were the weavers with an occasional female weaver. In the Egyptian\nDesert and in Seistan in the present day with horizontal looms the\nweavers appear to be males, but among the nomads of Persia who\nlikewise use horizontal looms the weavers are females. In the use of\neither form of loom the Egyptian weavers beat the weft downwards or\ntowards themselves and _not_ upwards or away from themselves. They had\nthe heddle in one of its earliest forms and had consequently made the\nfirst great step in the evolution of the loom as we now know it. In\nthe beginning they made no selvedges so that for every pick a separate\nlength of weft thread was used. The adoption of the selvedge was\nanother improvement and until it was introduced the weft would no\ndoubt have been put through with the fingers, later on a spool being\nused. It is possible also that in very late times the weavers\' comb\nwas introduced. It is safe to say that the Egyptians had no knowledge\nof the reed. Both forms of looms were simple, without harness or other\ncomplicated pieces of mechanism. The Egyptians accomplished fairly\ngood work and judging these people from their looms alone we must\nconclude they were a progressive race.\n\nThe Greek form of loom was an upright one on which the warp threads\nwere kept taut by means of weights and similar to the form which\nexisted in Central and Northern Europe (in the latter until recent\ntimes) but of which so far there is no trace to the east, or south, or\nwest. The Greek loom may have been furnished with a heddle but the\ndrawings are not clear on this point. A spool was used. The weavers\nwere women and the weft was beaten upwards or away from the weaver. It\nwas not a form of loom so capable of improvement as the Egyptian forms\nand there appears to be no connection between the forms used on either\nside of the Mediterranean. The Greek tapestry loom could hardly have\nbeen more primitive. In respect to the forms of looms used by the two\npeoples the Egyptians were considerably in advance of the Greeks.\n\n\nFINIS.\n\n\n\n\nTranscriber\'s Note\n\nPunctuation errors have been repaired.\n\nThe author uses some archaic and alternative spelling, for example,\nnooze for noose, gramms for grammes.

The investigations of that great\nphilosopher are so valuable, so full of instructions that we are led to\nreprint them, together with those of Mr. C. J. Burnett, on the salts of\nuranium, etc., as an Introduction.  It will be seen that the process by\nwhich blue prints are to-day obtained is exactly that Sir John Herschel\ndevised in 1840.\n\n“It is no longer an insulated and anomalous affection of certain salts of\nsilver or gold, but one which, doubtless, in a greater or less degree,\npervades all nature, and connects itself intimately with the mechanism by\nwhich chemical combination and decomposition is operated.  The general\ninstability of organic combinations might lead us to expect the occurrence\nof numerous and remarkable cases of this affection among bodies of that\nclass, but among metallic and other elements inorganically arranged,\ninstances enough have already appeared, and more are daily presenting\nthemselves, to justify its extension to all cases in which chemical\nelements may be supposed combined with a certain degree of laxity, and so\nto speak in a _tottering equilibrium_.  There can be no doubt that the\nprocess, in a great majority, if not in all cases, which have been noticed\namong inorganic substances, is a deoxidizing one, so far as the more\nrefrangible rays are concerned.  It is obviously so in the cases of gold\nand silver.  In the case of the bichromate of potash it is most probable\nthat an atom of oxygen is parted with, and so of many others.  A beautiful\nexample of such deoxidizing action on a non-argentine compound has lately\noccurred to me in the examination of that interesting salt, the\nferrosesquicyanuret of potassium described by Mr. Smee in the\n_Philosophical Magazine_, No. 109, September, 1840, and he has shown how\nto manufacture in abundance and purity, by voltaic action on the common or\nyellow ferrocyanuret.  In this process nascent oxygen is absorbed,\nhydrogen given off, and the characters of the resulting compound in\nrespect of the oxides of iron, forming as it does Prussian blue with proto\nsalts, indicate an excess of electro-negative energy, a disposition to\npart with oxygen, or which is the same thing, to absorb hydrogen (in the\npresence of moisture), and thereby to return to its pristine state, under\ncircumstances of moderate solicitation, such as the affinity of protoxide\nof iron (for instance) for an additional dose of oxygen, etc.”\n\n“Paper simply washed with a solution of this salt is highly sensitive to\nthe action of the light.  Prussian blue is deposited (the base being\nnecessarily supplied by the destruction of one portion of the acid, and\nthe acid by the destruction of another).  After half an hour or an hour’s\nexposure to sunshine, a very beautiful negative photograph is the result,\nto fix which, all that is necessary is to soak it in water in which a\nlittle sulphate of soda is dissolved.  While dry the impression is of a\ndove color or lavender blue, which has a curious and striking effect on\nthe greenish yellow ground of the paper produced by the saline solution.\nAfter washing the ground color disappears and the photograph becomes\nbright blue on a white ground.  If too long exposed, it gets\n‘over-sunned,’ and the tint has a brownish or yellowish tendency, which,\nhowever, is removed in fixing; but no increase of intensity beyond a\ncertain point is obtained by the continuance of exposure.”\n\n“If paper be washed with a solution of ammonio-citrate of iron and dried\nand then a wash passed over it of the yellow ferro-cyanuret of potassium,\nthere is no immediate formation of true Prussian blue, but the paper\nrapidly acquires a violet-purple color, which deepens after a few minutes,\nas it dries, to almost absolute blackness.  In this state it is a positive\nphotographic paper of high sensibility, and gives pictures of great depth\nand sharpness, but with this peculiarity, that they darken again\nspontaneously on exposure to the air in darkness, and are soon\nobliterated.  The paper, however, remains susceptible to light, and\ncapable of receiving other pictures, which in their turn fade, without any\npossibility (so far as I can see) of arresting them, which is to be\nregretted, as they are very beautiful, and the paper of such easy\npreparation.  If washed with ammonia or its carbonate, they are for a few\nmoments entirely obliterated, _but presently reappear with reversed lights\nand shades_.  In this state they are fixed, and the ammonia, with all that\nit will dissolve, being removed by washing in water, their color becomes a\npure Prussian blue, which deepens much by keeping.  If the solution be\nmixed there results a very dark violet-colored ink, which may be kept\nuninjured in an opaque bottle, and will readily furnish by a single wash\nat a moment’s notice the positive paper in question, which is most\nsensitive when wet.”\n\n“It seems at first sight natural to refer these curious and complex\nchanges to the instability of the cyanic compounds; and that this opinion\nis to a certain extent correct is proved by the photographic impressions\nobtained on papers to which no iron has been added beyond what exists in\nthe ferrocyanic salts themselves.  Nevertheless, the following experiments\nabundantly prove that in several of the changes above described, the\n_immediate action_ of the solar rays is not exerted on these salts, but on\nthe iron contained in the ferruginous solution added to them, which it\ndeoxidizes or otherwise alters, thereby presenting it to the ferrocyanic\nsalts in such a form as to precipitate the acids in combination with the\nperoxide, or protoxide of iron, as the case may be.  To make this evident,\nall that is necessary is _simply to leave out the ferrocyanate_ in the\npreparation of the paper, which thus becomes reduced to a simple washing\nover with the ammonio-citric solution.  Paper so washed is of a bright\nyellow color, and is apparently little, but in reality highly sensitive to\nphotographic action. Exposed to strong sunshine, for some time indeed, its\nbright yellow tint is dulled into an ochrey hue, or even to gray, but the\nchange altogether amounts to a moderate percentage of the total light\nreflected, and in short exposures is such as would easily escape notice.\nNevertheless, if a slip of this paper be held for only four or five\nseconds in the sun (the effect of which is quite imperceptible to the\neye), and when withdrawn into the shade be washed over with the\nferrosesquicyanate of potash, a considerable deposit of Prussian blue\ntakes place on the sunned part, and none whatever on the rest; so that on\nwashing the whole with water, a pretty strong blue impression is left,\ndemonstrating the reduction of iron in that portion of the paper to the\nstate of protoxide.  The effect in question is not, it should be observed,\npeculiar to ammonio-nitrate of iron.”\n\n“The ammonio and potasso-tartrate fully possess and the perchloride\n_exactly neutralized_ partakes of the same property; but the experiment is\nfar more neatly made and succeeds better with the other salts.”\n\n“The varieties of cyanotype processes seem to be innumerable, but that\nwhich I shall now describe deserves particular notice not only for its\npre-eminent beauty while in progress, but as illustrating the peculiar\npower of the ammoniacal and other parsalts of iron above-mentioned to\nreceive a latent picture susceptible of development by a great variety of\nstimuli.  This process consists in simply passing over the\nammonio-citrated paper on which such a latent picture has been impressed,\n_very sparingly and evenly_, a wash of the solution of the common yellow\nferrocyanate (prussiate) of potash.  The latent picture, if not so faint\nas to be quite invisible (and for this purpose it should not be so), is\nnegative.  As soon as the liquid is applied, which cannot be in too thin a\nfilm, the negative picture vanishes, and by very slow degrees is replaced\nby a positive one of a violet blue color on a greenish yellow ground,\nwhich at a certain moment possesses a high degree of sharpness and\nsingular beauty and delicacy of tint.  If at this instant it be thrown\ninto water, it passes immediately to a Prussian blue, losing, at the same\ntime, however, much of its sharpness, and sometimes indeed becoming quite\nblotty and confused.”\n\n“To prevent this confusion gum arabic may be added to the prussiated\nsolution, by which it is hindered from spreading unmanageably within the\npores of the paper, and the precipitated Prussian blue allowed time to\nagglomerate and fix itself on the fibers. By the use of this ingredient\nalso, a much thinner and more equal film may be spread over the surface,\nand _when perfectly dry_, if not sufficiently developed, the application\nmay be repeated. By operating thus I have occasionally (though rarely)\nsucceeded in producing pictures of great beauty and richness of effect,\nwhich they retain (if not thrown in water) between the leaves of a\nportfolio, and have a certain degree of fixity—fading in strong light and\nrecovering their tone in the dark. * * *”\n\n“If paper be washed with a mixture of the solutions of ammonio-citrate of\niron and ferrosesquicyanate (red prussiate) of potash, so as to contain\nthe two salts in about equal proportions, and being then impressed with a\npicture, be thrown into water and dried, a negative blue picture will be\nproduced.  This picture I have found to be susceptible of a very curious\ntransformation.  To effect this it must be washed with a solution of\nprotonitrate of mercury, which in a little time entirely discharges it.\nThe nitrate being thoroughly washed out and the picture dried, a smooth\niron is passed over it, somewhat hotter than is used for ironing linen,\nbut not sufficiently so to scorch or injure the paper.  The obliterated\npicture immediately reappears, not blue, but brown. If kept for some weeks\nin this state between the leaves of a portfolio, in complete darkness, it\nfades, and at length almost disappears.  But what is very singular, a\nfresh application of heat revives and restores it to its full intensity.”\n\n“This curious transformation is instructive in another way. It is not\noperated by light, at least not by light alone. _A certain temperature_\nmust be attained, and that temperature suffices in complete darkness.\nNevertheless, I find that on exposing to a very concentrated spectrum\n(collected by a lens of short focus) a slip of paper prepared as above\n(that is to say, by washing with the mixed solutions, exposure to\nsunshine, washing and discharging the uniform blue color so induced, as in\nthe last article), its whiteness is changed to a brown over the whole\nregion of the red and orange rays, _but not beyond_ the luminous spectrum.\nThree conclusions seem unavoidable: first—that it is the heat of these\nrays, not their light, which operates the change; second—that this heat\npossesses a peculiar chemical quality which is not possessed by the purely\ncalorific rays outside of the visible spectrum, though far more intense;\nand third—that the heat radiated from obscurely hot iron abounds\nespecially in rays analogous to those of the region of the spectrum above\nindicated.”\n\nSir John Herschel then proceeds to show that whatever be the state of the\niron in the double salts in question, its reduction by blue light to the\nstate of protoxide is indicated by many other agents.  “Thus, for\nexample,” says Robert Hunt, “if a slip of paper prepared with the\nammonio-citrate of iron be exposed partially to sunshine, and then washed\nwith the bichromate of potash, the bichromate is deoxidized and\nprecipitated upon the sunned portion, just as it would be if directly\nexposed to the sun’s rays.”\n\n“I have proved this fact with a great number of preparations of cobalt,\nnickel, bismuth, platinum and other salts which have been thought hitherto\nto be insensitive to the solar agency; but if they are partially sunned\nand then washed with nitrate of silver and put aside in the dark, the\nmetallic silver is slowly reduced upon the sunned portion.  In many\ninstances days were required to produce the visible picture; and in one\ncase paper being washed in the dark with neutral chloride of platinum was\nsunned and then washed in the dark with nitrate of silver; it was some\nweeks before the image made its appearance, but it was eventually\nperfectly developed, and, when quite so, remained permanently impressed\nupon the paper.”\n\nThe following process, discovered at the same time as the cyanotype, and\ntermed chrysotype, is thus described by Sir John Herschel:\n\n“In order to ascertain whether any portion of the iron in the double\nammoniacal salt employed has really undergone deoxidation, I had recourse\nto a solution of gold, exactly neutralized by carbonate of soda.  The\nproto-salts of iron, as is well known to chemists, precipitate gold in the\nmetallic state.  The effect proved exceedingly striking, and, as the\nexperiment will probably be repeated by others, I shall here describe it\nab initio.  Paper is to be washed with a moderately concentrated solution\nof ammonio-citrate of iron and dried.  The strength of solution should be\nsuch as to dry into a good yellow color, not at all brown.  In this state\nit is ready to receive a photographic image, which may be impressed on it\neither from nature in the camera obscura, or from an engraving on a frame\nin sunshine.  The image so impressed is, however, very faint, and\nsometimes hardly perceptible.  The moment it is removed from the frame or\ncamera, it must be washed over with a neutral solution of chloride of gold\nof such strength as to have about the color of a sherry wine.  Instantly\nthe picture appears, not, indeed, at once of its full intensity, but\ndarkening with great rapidity up to a certain point, depending on the\nstrength of the solutions used, etc.  At this point nothing can surpass\nthe sharpness and perfection of detail of the resulting photograph.  To\narrest this process and to fix the picture (so far at least as the further\nagency of light is concerned), it is to be thrown into water very slightly\nacidulated with sulphuric acid, and well soaked, dried, washed with\nhydrobromate of potash, rinsed and dried again. * * *”\n\n“In point of _direct_ sensibility, the chrysotype paper is certainly\ninferior to the calotype; but it is one of the most remarkable\npeculiarities of gold as a photographic ingredient, that _extremely feeble\nimpressions once made by light go on afterwards, darkening spontaneously\nand very slowly, apparently without limit so long as the least vestige of\nunreduced chloride of gold remains in the paper_.  To illustrate this\ncurious and (so far as applications go) highly important property, I shall\nmention incidentally the results of some experiments made during the late\nfine weather on the habitudes of gold in presence of oxalic acid.  It is\nwell known to chemists that this acid, heated with solutions of gold,\nprecipitates the metal in its metallic state; it is upon this property\nthat Berzelius has founded his determination of the atomic weight of gold.\nLight, as well as heat, also operates this precipitation; but to render it\neffectual, several conditions are necessary:—First—the solution of gold\nshould be neutral, or at most _very_ slightly acid; secondly—the oxalic\nacid must be added in the form of a neutral oxalate; and thirdly—it must\nbe present in a certain considerable quantity, which quantity must be\ngreater the greater the amount of free acid present in the chloride.\nUnder this condition, the gold is precipitated by light as a black powder\nif the liquid be in any bulk; and if merely washed over paper, a stain is\nproduced, which, however feeble at first, under a certain dosage of the\nchloride, oxalate and free acid, goes on increasing from day to day and\nfrom week to week, when laid by in the dark and especially in a damp\natmosphere, till it acquires almost the black of ink; the unsunned portion\nof the paper remaining unaffected, or so slightly as to render it almost\ncertain that what little action of the kind exists is due to the effect of\ncasual dispersed light incident in the preparation of the paper.  I have\nbefore me a specimen of paper so treated in which the effect of thirty\nseconds’ exposure to sunshine was quite invisible at first, and which is\nnow of so intense a purple as may be well called black, while the unsunned\nportion has acquired comparatively but a slight brown.  And (what is not a\nlittle remarkable, and indicates that in the time of exposure mentioned\nthe _maximum_ of effect was attained) other portions of the same paper\nexposed in graduated progression for longer times, viz., one minute, two\nminutes, and three minutes, are not in the least perceptible degree darker\nthan the portion on which the light has acted during thirty seconds only.”\n\n“If paper prepared as above recommended for the chrysotype, either with\nthe ammonio-citrate or ammonio-tartrate of iron, and impressed, as in that\nprocess, with a latent picture, be washed with nitrate of silver instead\nof a solution of gold, a very sharp and beautiful picture is developed of\ngreat intensity.  Its disclosure is not instantaneous; a few moments\nelapse without apparent effect; the dark shades are then first touched in,\nand by degrees the details appear, but much more slowly than in the case\nof gold. In two or three minutes, however, the maximum of distinctness\nwill not fail to be obtained.  The picture may be fixed by the\nhyposulphite of soda, which alone, I believe, can be fully depended on for\nfixing argentic photographs.”\n\n“The best process for fixing the photographs prepared with gold is as\nfollows: As soon as the picture is satisfactorily brought out by the\nauriferous liquid, it is to be rinsed in spring water, which must be three\ntimes renewed, letting it remain in the third water five or ten minutes.\nIt is then to be blotted off and dried, after which it is to be washed on\nboth sides with a somewhat weak solution of hydriodate of potash.  If\nthere be any free chloride of gold present in the pores of the paper it\nwill be discolored, the lights passing to a ruddy brown; but they speedily\nwhiten again spontaneously, or at all events on throwing it (after lying a\nminute or two) into fresh water, in which, being again rinsed and dried,\nit is now perfectly fixed.”\n\nAs the chrysotype will be no more referred to, we shall state, first, that\nthe image can be developed with a plain solution of silver nitrate or one\nacidified with citric or any other organic acid, which generally gives a\nbrown impression that can be toned with an acid or alkaline gold bath, the\ncolor varying with the solution employed; and secondly, that the process\nmay be employed to obtain outlines of any picture on paper or canvas to be\ncolored in oil-paints.  The impression developed with gold terchloride is\npale blue, _quite permanent_, and does not at all interfere with the work\nof the artist.  The canvas should first be washed with a mixture of\nalcohol and aqueous ammonia, then dried and rubbed with pumice stone\npowder to give a _tooth_.  The modus operandi suggests itself.\n\nThe researches of Mr. C. J. Burnett on the application of uranium salts\nand other compounds to photography are recorded in the _Photographic\nNotes_ of Ths. Sutton for 1857.  We give in the following lines the most\ninteresting parts of the two papers of Mr. Burnett:\n\n* * * “The next class of processes are dependent on the sensitiveness to\nlight of the salts of uranic oxide or sesquioxide of uranium, U2O3.”\n\n“In the first process, the paper being charged with the uranic salt and\nexposed to the solar influence under the negative to be copied, is washed\nwith a solution of the ferridcyanide or red prussiate of potash.  The\n‘Harvest Scene’ in the exhibition, being from an albumen negative lent me\nby Mr. Ross, the well-known Edinburgh photographer, is an example, the\nsalt of the sesquioxide of uranium being in this case the hydrofluate, and\nthe time of exposure from the strength of the albumen negative fully an\nhour of good sunshine.  I have used for the solution of the uranic oxide\nfor this process a variety of acids with very similar results; the\nsensitiveness of the prepared paper to light varying much, however.  For\ninstance, a collodion negative with the hydrofluate paper producing a very\ngood print in half an hour of unsteady sun, while with a paper prepared\nwith the tartaric acid solution of the oxide, it gave an equally good\nimpression in less than five minutes of the same intermitting sunshine,\nindicating thus a difference of sensitiveness of six to one in favor of\nthe tartrate.”\n\n“The rationale of this process is the reduction of the sesqui-oxide of\nuranium, U2O3, on those parts of the paper exposed to the solar influence,\nto a lower state of oxidation, the photo-oxide UO, the salts of which have\nthe property of forming with soluble alkaline ferridcyanides a rich\nchocolate-brown precipitate, while the salts of the sesquioxide are\ndestitute of this reaction.  Hence the brown deposit on the parts of the\npicture on which the sun has been allowed to act when the developing\nsolution is applied, and the absence of any such appearance on those parts\nwhich have been protected from its influence.”\n\n“As to the manipulatory details of this process, the paper is floated on\nthe solution in a dark room and hung up to dry, and then preserved from\nlight in a portfolio.  If carefully secluded from light it appears to keep\nwell.  After exposure for the proper time under this negative, there is in\nsome cases scarcely any visible impression; while in other cases,\nparticularly when using the tartaric solution, I have found the impression\nvery distinguishable, of a brownish or blackish shade, although still\nquite faint.  The development is best conducted by floating it, anything\nlike rubbing the picture being very objectionable.”\n\n“When the picture has fully come out, which is generally from three to ten\nminutes at the very most, it is removed from the developing bath, placed\nin cold water and washed very gently for a few minutes, the water being\nfrequently changed till it ceases to acquire a yellow tinge from the\ndissolved red prussiate.  The picture is then drained from the water,\npressed between folds of blotting paper, dried (I dry in the dark), and\nthe process is complete. * * * I may state, as one recommendation of this\nprocess to ladies and other lovers of clean hands, that any brown stains\nleft by it on the fingers or elsewhere are at once removable by a little\nweak ammonia or soap and water. * * * I would particularly suggest, as\ndeserving of notice, the development of the salts of sesquioxide of\nuranium, and still more iron, by the metals and metallic-cyanic alkaline\nsalts, as also by the mellonides and nitro-prussides, and the latter also\nby itself and as developed by many metallic salts.”\n\n“I have since had the opportunity of trying the nitro-prusside of sodium,\nwhich, by itself, gives a blue and white picture, in color like that\nobtained from the red prussiate of potash.”\n\n“When mixed with a solution of ammonio-nitrate of copper, previous to its\napplication to the paper, the color obtained is pale purplish pink or\npeach-blossom color. By mixing it in the same way with ammonio-oxalate of\nsesquioxide of iron, we get a dull green picture, changeable through\nintermediate stages into brown by alkaline carbonates, and that into a\n_dirty_ black by gallic acid.  It may be well to know that the blue of the\npicture given by the red prussiate in the process of Sir John Herschel may\nbe considerably modified or entirely changed to another color, in many\nways, without interfering with the purity of the white ground, by steeping\nthe picture, after the undecomposed red prussiate has been washed out, in\nsolution of salts of various metals, copper, uranium or cobalt, for\ninstance, and that the colors so produced may be modified as desired,\naccording to the stage at which the action is stopped.”\n\n“There remains but one class of uranic photographs to be described,\nnamely, that obtained when we develop with a salt of silver or gold (or\nplatinum?).  This class may be made to print much more rapidly than our\nordinary silver printing process, approaching sometimes more nearly to the\ncalotype development in this respect.  We get the _minutest details_ with\ngreat fidelity, and the picture is effectually fixed by a simple fresh\nhyposulphite solution, with a good color in many cases, or by ammonia,\nwhich will be considered an advantage by those who hold the hyposulphite\nan enemy to durability.  Different shades of color are produced according\nto different solvent acids and different details.  I have got a good black\nperfectly like that of an engraving, by the nitrate of uranic oxide,\ndeveloped by ammonio-nitrate of silver (or plain nitrate) and fixed by\nplain hyposulphite without any coloring bath. * * * I have tried the\nhyposulphite of gold on some of the silver-developed prints prepared with\nthe hydrofluate of the uranic oxide and fixed with ammonia, which had an\nexceedingly unpleasant raw-red color, a very agreeable gray was at once\nobtained.  I have succeeded in getting very beautiful impressions by\ndevelopment of the uranic paper by chloride of gold alone.”\n\nIn another communication to the _Photographic Notes_, more interesting\nperhaps than the foregoing, Mr. Burnett says:\n\n“The clearest and brightest of my results have been obtained by the action\nof gallic acid, tannin, or especially a _mixture of tannin and carbonate\nof ammonia_, potash or soda, on the blue pictures obtained by the\nsolarization of paper prepared with ferridcyanide of potassium,\nferrocyanide or ferridcyanide of ammonium. * * * I have also experimented\nwith the bichromate and iron, with gallic, tannin and other developer; but\nI must confess to not having been, in this particular way, so successful\nas Mr. Sella appears to have been in the preservation of the whites, owing\npossibly to my not having taken the trouble to wash out sufficiently the\niron before toning.”(1)\n\n“I have experimented most extensively in many ways with the chromates and\nbichromates, and have succeeded in various ways in getting _very good_\nresults.  A very capital process for many purposes is to float or steep\nyour paper in a mixed solution of bichromate of potash and sulphate of\ncopper.  As for E. Hunt’s chromotype process,” (2) I have mixed gelatine,\nor occasionally grape sugar, or both, with the solution, but instead of\ndeveloping it by a silver solution, as in the chromotype, wash out the\nsalts unacted on by light, and develop by floating on a solution of\nferrocyanide of potassium.  The color of the red copper salt which now\nforms the picture may be modified or changed in many ways, viz., by\nsoaking the picture, after the ferrocyanide of potassium has been washed\nout of the lights, in a solution of sulphate of iron (or the iron salt\nmay, but not so advantageously, have been applied to the picture before\nthe application of the ferrocyanide).  Solutions of chloride of tin,\ngallic and tannic acids, alone or with alkalies or alkaline carbonates,\nmay also be employed to modify or change the color.  Instead of developing\nby ferrocyanide you may develop by the cobalt or chromo-cyanogen salts, or\nby an alkaline _mellonide_ arsenite, etc.  Sulphureted hydrogen, or a\nsulphide, will give a _brown_, or _black_ tone, which may be protected\nagainst oxygen and dampness by a resinous varnish.\n\n“Of all the simple pictures obtainable with bichromated papers, without\ncomplications or other tonings, those obtainable by the combination of a\nsalt (say the sulphate) of _manganese_, with the bichromate in the paper\npreparation, are about the best; these pictures being, however, capable of\nbeing toned and modified in many different ways if desired.  This may be\naccomplished by the use of toning baths of ferridcyanide or ferrocyanide,\nor other metal cyanogen salts, etc., or by either mixing the salts of\nother metals, as copper or iron, with the cyanic toning baths, or using\nthem in the original solution, or by soaking the paper in them, as in\nSella’s process, previously to the application of the metal cyanic,\nmellonic or other toning baths.  Alkalies and alkaline carbonates may also\nbe used to remove the chromic acid, and leave a subsalt, or the very\nstable oxide or carbonate of manganese, which may be peroxidized by the\nuse of chloride of lime, peroxide of hydrogen, or ozone.”\n\n“In all the processes with metallic salts, alone with bichromates, the use\nof sized or unsized paper along with gelatine, etc., has some advantages.\nI have got good results by such processes on albumen paper, the albumen\ntending to prevent mealiness in the print; also on paper soaked in\ngelatine before the application of the bichromic solution. * * * There is\ngreat interest connected with the action of all such papers, along with\nthe tannin and vegetable coloring matters.  I have long been of opinion\nthat by the steeping of papers or textile fabrics, containing the salts\nnot only of iron, as recommended by Mr. Sella, but of tin, copper,\nbismuth, lead, etc., in solutions of cochineal, red cabbage, beetroot,\ngrass or the most ordinary foliage, etc., that the most useful results\nmight be obtained; though for _certain_ permanence I am not sure but that\nsome of the other processes which I have briefly run over with the\ncyanogen acid salts or metallic acid salts, as precipitators, may be more\nto be depended upon.  The processes with _precipitated oxides_, such as\nthe one with manganese and similar ones, with other metals which I have\ndescribed, I also consider as deserving of more attention than almost any\nprocesses which have been stated, on the score of probable permanence; but\nperhaps the best process for black, or generally useful neutral tint,\nwithout silver, that has yet been offered to the public, I believe to be\nthe process alluded to with the bichromate of potash and sulphate of\ncopper, toned by an iron salt.  *  *  *  This process, the cuprotype (as\nalso the uranotype and manganotype) is applicable perfectly to films of\n_albumen_ or gelatine on glass or porcelain, textile fabrics, parchment,\npaper, tiles and many other substances besides paper.”\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE DESIGNS.\n\n\n\n\n                      HOW TO MAKE A NEGATIVE DRAWING\n\n\nThe drawing paper for designs to be reproduced by the cyantotype and the\nother processes described in this book should be of a fine texture, free\nfrom opacities and very white; and, as the design must serve as a cliché\nit is a sine qua non that it be drawn with a very black ink and with\nwell-fed lines, especially those which are very fine.  To obtain a\ncomplete opacity, and, at the same time, to keep the ink quite fluid,\nwhich gives great facility to the designer, one adds some gamboge (or\nburnt sienna) to the India ink.  The ink of Bourgeois, which is compounded\nwith yellow and can be diluted as easily as India ink, is excellent, so is\nalso the American ink of Higgins.(3)\n\nAs much as possible it is desirable to replace the colored lines\nindicating the constructions, the axis, projections, etc., by differently\npunctuated lines made with India ink.  However, if the use of colors be\nobligatory on the original design, one should trace the red lines with\nvery thick vermilion or sienna, the yellow lines with gamboge, and the\nblue and green lines with a thick mixture of Prussian blue and chrome\nyellow in different proportions.\n\nOne must abstain from applying washes of any tints on the original. If\nnecessary they should be brushed over when the reproductions are made;\nmoreover they can be often replaced by cross-lines more or less open, and\nthe shadowing represented by thicker but not closer lines.\n\nTracing paper is recommended instead of linen, which latter, on account of\nits thickness and granulation, gives less satisfactory results in regard\nto the transparency of the ground and the continuity of the lines.\n\nTo reproduce a design on ordinary paper—not too thick—or an engraving,\netc., the paper is rendered transparent by rubbing over on the back of the\noriginal a solution of 3 parts in volume of castor oil in 10 parts of\nalcohol, by means of a small sponge.  When the paper is quite transparent,\nthe oil in excess is removed by pressure between sheets of blotting paper,\nand the paper dried before the fire or spontaneously.  The design so\ntreated is not in the least injured, for it assumes its primitive\ncondition by dissolving the oil from the paper by immersion into strong\nalcohol, which it is necessary to renew once or twice, then rinsing in\nalcoholized water if the drawing be in India ink, or simply in water in\nthe case of an engraving, and finally drying between sheets of blotting\npaper.\n\nInstead of an alcoholic solution of castor oil, vaseline can be employed.\nThe paper is more transparent.\n\nThe method by which are made negative drawings, that is, those which can\nbe used as negative clichés to reproduce the design in black lines on a\nwhite ground, is thus described by Mr. Cheysson, wlio originated it, in a\nmanual published by the Department of Public Works of France, from which\nwe have borrowed most of the above instructions for the drawing of designs\nsuitable for the photo-reproduction processes:(4)\n\n“One can avoid the necessity of making a negative from the original\ndrawing by transforming the drawing itself into a negative.”\n\n“To that effect it suffices to draw with lithographic ink, then to cover\nthe paper with aniline brown, and, after drying, to wash it with\nturpentine oil which dissolves the lithographic ink without altering the\naniline.  The lines appear then white on a brown ground impervious to\nlight (that is, non-actinic).  The design is thus transformed into a\nnegative, and can yield positive impressions with paper sensitized with\nsilver salts, the ferriprussiate or the bichromate of potash.  The\nlithographic ink should be very black and the lines well fed.”\n\n“When the drawing is finished it is placed on a board lined with sheets of\nblotting paper, then one spreads all over it the aniline brown with a\nbrush, and, lastly, after drying, the paper is carefully rubbed with a\nbung of cotton or a rag imbued with turpentine until the lines of the\ndesign are dissolved.”\n\nIn our practice we have often taken a negative cliché from drawings made\nin the ordinary manner, without the aid of the camera obscura (which would\nhave been too expensive for drawings of a certain size), by simply\nprinting a proof by contact on plain or albumenized silvered paper, and\nfixing, without toning, in a new solution of sodium thiosulphate, then\nwashing as usual.   The proofs thus obtained from designs drawn with an\nopaque ink, which allows a long insulation and, therefore, yields an\nintense reduction, are of a deep brick-red color, quite non-actinic, and\ngive very good positives by the Artigues process.\n\nN.B.—Paper in drying never assumes its original shape; it is, therefore,\nnecessary to make the figures on the reproductions from plans when they\nare not on the originals.\n\n\n\n\n                         CHOICE OF PAPER. SIZING.\n\n\nIn all the photographic processes by precipitation of metallic oxides the\nquality of the paper has a great influence on the results. When the paper\nis not well sized and not well calendered, the sensitizing solution is\nabsorbed, instead of simply impregnating the surface of the paper, and not\nonly the image is sunk in and its sharpness impaired, but good whites can\nnever be obtained, especially if the image should be toned, owing to the\nimpossibility of eliminating the metallic salts not acted on, that is, not\nreduced by the action of light which the fibers of the paper mechanically\nretain.\n\nThe “endless” rolls of paper, 54: inches wide—or “blue print paper,” as it\nis sometimes termed—of Blanchet fréres et Kléber, of Rives, better known\nas “Rives’ paper”, that of Johannot, of Annonay (France), and the\nSteinbach (Saxe) paper are recommended.\n\nFor small prints from negatives in half tone the positive paper, 18×22\ninches, of Rives or Saxe, should be preferred to the heavy kind.  It is\nadvisable to size it, so that the impressions be entirely formed on the\nsurface of the paper.  Moreover, an additional sizing is always\nadvantageous, whatever be the photographic process employed, to prevent\nthe imbibition of the sensitizing compound and to obtain more brilliant\nand vigorous images, for the iron, chromium, uranium and other metallic\nsoluble salts require the presence of an organic matter (alcohol, ether,\ngum arabic, glucose, caseine, etc.) to be reduced by the agency of light;\nand as a consequence, the greater, within certain limits, of course, the\namount of organic matters, and the more thoroughly they are mixed with the\nsalts, the more sensitive the preparation and the better the results.\n\nArrowroot is the best sizing for our purposes.  Gelatine may be employed,\nalbumen also, but the coating should be insolubized when applied on the\npaper and dry.\n\n_Sizing with Arrowroot._—In a porcelain dish diffuse 4 parts of powdered\narrowroot and one part of liquid glucose in 200 parts of distilled or rain\nwater and dissolve by heat over an alcohol lamp, stirring all the while.\nLet the solution boil for an instant, and when the paste is homogeneous\nlet it cool down and then remove the skin formed on its surface and strain\nit through a fine canvas.  Now provide with three small sponges free from\ngritty matters and cleaned in water, and nail by the four corners, one\nover the other, felt size uppermost, as many sheets of paper as you wish\nto size on a board somewhat smaller than the paper.  This done, with one\nof the sponges take a small quantity of the arrowroot and, brushing it\nlength-way and cross-way, spread the paste into an even layer, then, by\nrubbing very lightly with the second sponge, efface the striae and smooth\nthe coating as well as possible.  The third sponge serves to remove the\nexcess of paste when too much is at first spread on.  From six to seven\nsheets of paper, 18×22, can be sized with the quantity of arrowroot paste\nabove given.\n\nAnother, but not quite so effective a manner of sizing although sufficient\nfor the cyanotype, is the following, employed by Mr. Pizzighelli for the\npaper used in the platinotypic process:\n\nTen parts of arrowroot are powdered in a mortar with a little water and\nthen mixed by small quantities to 800 parts of boiling water. After a few\nminutes 200 parts of alcohol are added and the mixture filtered.  The\npaper is immersed for two or three minutes in the warm solution and hung\nup to dry.\n\n_Sizing, with Gelatine._—Dissolve at a temperature of about 140 deg. Fahr.\n(60 deg. C.) 10 parts of good gelatine in 800 parts of water, then add 200\nparts of alcohol and 3 parts of alum dissolved in a little water.  Filter\nand prepare the paper by immersion as above directed.  The gelatinized\npaper when dry should be prepared a second time and dried by hanging it up\nin the opposite direction in order to obtain an even coating.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CYANOTYPE OR BLUE PROCESS.\n\n\n_This process gives white impressions on a blue ground with diapositives\nor drawings on transparent or semi-transparent materials, and blue\nimpressions on a white ground from negatives._  It is commonly known under\nthe names of “blue print process,” “negative ferrotype process” and\n“ferro-prussiate process.”\n\nThe process is indeed exceedingly simple.  A sheet of paper, impregnated\nor sensitized, as it is termed, with a solution of ferric citrate and\nferricyanate is impressed under a cliché,(5) then immersed in pure water,\nwhereby the image is developed and at the same time fixed. It is on\naccount of the great advantages offered by its simplicity that this\nprocess is generally preferred by civil engineers and architects for the\nreproduction of their plans.\n\nThe sensitizing solution is prepared in mixing by equal volumes the two\nsolutions following:\n\nA.   Iron, ammonio       20 parts\n     citrate\n     Water               100 parts\nB.   Potassium           15 parts\n     ferricyanate (red\n     prussiate)\n     Water               100 parts\n\nAlthough the mixture keeps pretty well for a certain period in the dark,\nit is best to prepare only the quantity wanted for actual use.(6)\n\nThe paper is preferably sensitized in operating as follows:\n\nTake hold of the paper by the two opposite corners and fold it into a\nloop, lay it on the iron solution, the center of the sheet first placed in\ncontact with the liquid, and then gradually spread it by lowering the\ncorners with a little pressure.  No solution should run over on the back\nof the paper; it would be a cause of stain.  This done, and without\nallowing the liquid to penetrate _in_ the paper, immediately take hold of\nthe two corners near the body and withdraw the paper by dragging it over\non a glass rod for this purpose fixed on the edge of the tray.  Now pin up\nthe paper to dry, which should be done rapidly, and sensitize a second\ntime in proceeding in the same manner.  If this second sensitizing be\nfound objectionable, let float the paper for no more than ten seconds; of\ncourse this method of sensitizing is not applicable to prepare larger\nsheets of paper.  In this case the paper is pinned by the four corners on\na drawing board or any other support, lined with blotting paper and\nquickly brushed over with a sponge sparingly imbued with the sensitizing\nmixture, so as to wet the paper with a very small excess of liquid.\n\nThe rationale of this manner of sensitizing is to impregnate only the very\nsurface of the paper with the ferric salts, and thereby to obtain an\nintense blue with very good whites, which latter it would be impossible of\nobtaining should the sensitizing solution be allowed to reach in the\nfibers of the paper, for, in this condition, it is impossible, owing to\nthe exigencies of the process, to wash out thoroughly the iron salts to\nprevent the chemical changes which cause the whites to be tinted blue.  It\nis for this reason that better results are also obtained with well sized\npapers.\n\nThe sensitizing should be done by a very diffused daylight, and the\ndrying, of course, in a dark room.  When sensitized the paper is yellowish\ngreen.  It should be well dried for keeping, and rolled or wrapped in\norange or brown paper and preserved from the action of dampness and of the\nair.  It does not keep well, however, no more than two or three months,\nperhaps, in good condition; but the sooner it is employed the finer the\nproofs, the better the whites and more rapidly is the paper impressed.\n\nThere is in the market a paper which keeps for a long time.  It is\nprepared by adding a small quantity of gum arabic or of dextrine to the\nsensitizing solution.  Good for the reproduction of line work, it does not\ngive very satisfactory results for pictures in half tones.\n\nThe following compound gives a paper much more sensitive, but not keeping\nso long, than that prepared according to the formula previously given:\n\nTartaric acid               25 parts\nFerric chloride, solution   80 parts (in volume)\nat 45 deg. Baumé\nWater                       100 parts\n\nWhen the acid is dissolved, add gradually concentrated aqueous ammonia,\njust enough to neutralize the solution—170 volumes, about.  The chemical\nchange consists in the formation of ferric tartrate.  Let cool the\nsolution, then, after adding the following, keep it in the dark:\n\nPotassium ferricyanate   21½ parts\nWater                    100 parts\n\nAnother and very sensitive preparation is the following:\n\nA.    Iron perchloride,   40 parts\n      cryst\n      Oxalic acid         10 parts\n      Water               100 parts\nB.    Potassium           20 parts\n      ferricyanate\n      Water               100 parts\nMix\n\n_Printing._—The process we describe yields negative impressions, that is a\npositive image from a negative cliché, and a negative image from a\npositive cliché, exactly as the silver printing-out process ordinarily\nemployed in photography.  Consequently, for the production of non-reversed\nproofs from plans, etc., the original drawing should be placed _face\ndownwards_ on the glass plate of the printing frame, and, upon the back,\nthe sensitive paper is laid and pressed into perfect contact by means of a\npad, felt or thick cloth.\n\nThe printing frame is that used by photographers. The lid is divided,\naccording to the side, in two, three and even four sections, held by\nhinges and fastened for printing by as many cross-bars, in order that by\nopening one section, from time to time, the operator can follow the\nprogressive changes resulting from the action of light on the iron salts.\nTo print, the frame should be placed in the light in such a manner as the\nluminous rays fall perpendicularly upon the drawing or cliché.  The reason\nof this is obvious, since the sensitive paper is not in direct contact\nwith the design, but separated by the material upon which it is drawn.\n\nDuring the insolation—whose time depends necessarily from the more or less\ntransparency of the cliché, and, also, from the intensity of the\nlight(7)—the paper assumes first a violet tint, which gradually\nintensifies to a dark shade; then this tint fades, becomes brownish, then\npale lilac, while the parts under the lines—that is, the design—upon which\nthe light has, therefore, no action, are visible by keeping the original\nyellow-green tint of the prepared paper. It is when the lilac color is\nproduced that the exposure is sufficient.\n\nTo ascertain when the exposure is correct, a few black lines can be traced\non one of the edges of the margin of the design, and strips of the\nsensitive paper placed upon them to serve as _tests_ in operating, as it\nwill be explained in the description of the Cyanofer process.  When one of\nthem is taken out and show, by being washed in water, a clear white line\non a deep blue ground, the exposure is at an end.  One understands that\nthe blue color of the ground is more or less intense according to time of\ninsolation, for the chemical actions between the reduced and the\nnon-reduced iron salts is so much more complete as the salts acted on are\nmore or less deoxidized, that is, reduced to ferrous salts; and that to\nobtain the maximum of effect, which, therefore, depends on the allowable\ntime of exposure, the drawing ink should be opaque and non-actinic as far\nas possible, because when, on testing, the lines are tinted the exposure\nshould be discontinued. However, a slight coloration of the lines is not\nvery objectionable, for it disappears by a longer washing after the\ndevelopment.\n\nThe image is developed and fixed by washing in water two or three times\nrenewed.  The water must be free from calcareous salts; these salts\nconverting the iron into carbonates which impart an ochrey tinge to the\nproof.   Rain water—any water in which no precipitate is thrown down by\nthe addition of a few drops of a weak solution of silver nitrate—may be\nused with safety.\n\nDuring the development the ground takes a blue color which rapidly\nintensifies, while the iron compound, not acted on and imparting a yellow\ngreen tint to the design, is washed out from the white paper.  If the\nprint has not been sufficiently exposed the ground remains pale blue, more\nor less; the reason has been explained.  In this case the development\nshould be done quickly, as the blue is always discharged by washing.  On\nthe other hand, whenever the whites are tinted by excess of exposure, they\ncan be cleared partly or entirely by a prolonged immersion in water, but\nthe ground is also to some extent lightened.\n\nWhen the proof is well developed and fixed, that is, when the soluble iron\nsalts are eliminated, the blue color can be brightened by adding to the\nlast but one washing water a small quantity of citric acid, or of\npotassium bisulphate, or a little of a solution of hypochlorite of lime\n(bleaching powder).\n\nThe action of light in this, as well as in the other photographic\nprocesses with metallic salts described in this work, is one of\ndeoxidation, as shown by Herschel.  The chemical changes which produce the\nblue precipitate is quite complicated.  It is evident that both the ferric\ncitrate and the ferric cyanate are partly reduced to ferrous salts under\nthe luminous influence, and react in presence of water with the unreduced\npart of each of these compounds, the ferric citrate with the ferrous\ncyanate forming Prussian blue (ferric-ferrocyanate), and the ferric\ncyanate with the ferrous citrate giving rise to Turnbull’s blue (ferrous\nferricyanate).  The blue of the print is consequently a mixture in a\ncertain proportion of the two compounds; and as the color of Prussian blue\nis quite different from that of Turnbull’s, it follows that by varying in\na certain measure the percentage of the two ferric salts forming the\nsensitizing solution, the color of the blue may be varied thereby. Hence\nthe difference in the formulas given by different authors.(8)\n\nThe blue color of the image can be changed into black or dark green. But\nto that purpose the paper should be, although not exactly necessary, well\nsized as before directed, and sensitized with extra care to prevent the\nimbibition of the iron solution into the paper. After exposure the proof\nshould necessarily be thoroughly washed to eliminate the soluble iron\nsalts, then immersed for a moment in water acidified with nitric acid,\n1:100, and this done and without washing treated by a solution of aqueous\nammonia at 2 per 100 of water.  In this the blue color disappears, being\nchanged into a red brownish tint, which indicates that the Turnbull’s and\nPrussian blues are transformed, the former into ferroso-ferric hydrate,\nwith formation of ferrocyanate, and the latter into ferric hydrate.  It is\nby the action of tannin (gallotannic acid) on the ferric oxides thus\nformed that the black is produced, and by that of catechu-tannic acid\ncontained in the extract of catechu that one obtains a dark green, almost\nblack color.\n\nTo obtain the black tone it suffices to immerse the proof on its removal\nfrom the ammoniacal in a solution of tannin at 5 per 100 of water, and\nwhen toned, to wash it in a few changes of water.\n\nThe process to turn the blue color into a green was devised by Mr. Paul\nRoy.  It is as follows: Dissolve 7 parts of borax in 100 parts of water,\nand acidify the solution with sulphuric acid added drop by drop until the\nlitmus paper becomes red; then, in the same manner, neutralize with\naqueous ammonia not in excess, but just enough to show an alkaline\nreaction; this done dissolve 1 part of powdered catechu and filter.  In\nthis the proof is immersed after development until the desired effect is\nattained.  Wash, etc.\n\nTo clear the lines, or to make additions, or to write on the blue margin\nof the proof a solution of potassium oxalate is employed. It dissolves the\nblue without leaving scarcely any trace of it.  The solution can be\nprepared by mixing the two solutions whose formula is given below:(9)\n\nA.   Oxalic acid       10 parts\n     Water             100 parts\nB.   Caustic potassa   12½ parts\n     Water             100 parts\n\nThe blue prints are permanent.  When drying they darken a little from\noxidation; exposed to sunshine for some hours, they bleach considerably;\nbut in the shade the faded pictures progressively absorb oxygen from the\nair and assume their original intensity and color in a period so much the\nlonger as the insulation has been more prolonged; it may take weeks if the\npicture were much bleached.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CYANOFER. (PELLET’S PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives blue impressions on a white ground from positive\nclichés, and white impressions on a blue ground from negative clichés._\nIt is termed “positive ferrotype process.”\n\nThe cyanofer is an application of one of the numerous and useful\ninventions for which photography is indebted to A. Poitevin.  In 1863 he\ndiscovered that certain organic substances were rendered insoluble by\nferric chloride, and that they again became soluble; when under the\ninfluence of light the ferric chloride has been reduced to a ferrous salt.\nThis curious phenomenon is the base of the process now to be described.\nAs usual the process has been modified by compounding the sensitive\nsolution in various ways and by minor details in the manner operating.\nBut although these modifications have rendered the process easier to work\nwith, there is not a great difference in the results obtained.  We give\ntwo formulas.  Aside from the addition of gum arabic, which was suggested\nby Mr. Pellet, and which constitutes the capital improvement of the\nprocess, the formula is substantially that devised by Mr. Poitevin.\n\nPrepare three solutions as follows:\n\nA.   Gum arabic, best   50 parts\n     quality\n     Water              170 parts\nB.   Tartaric acid      12 parts\n     Water              80 parts\nC.   Ferric chloride    35 parts in volume\n     solution at 45\n     deg. Baumé\n\nMix gradually B to C, then C, by small quantities, in agitating briskly.\nIt is important to prepare the solution as directed, for by adding the\nferric chloride before tartaric acid, the gum arabic would be at once\ncoagulated.  When the ferric chloride is mixed, the solution at first\nthickens, but becomes sufficiently fluid for use in a certain period.  It\ndoes not keep, and should be employed the day it is made if possible.\n\nThe paper, which should be well sized and calendered, and which, when not\ngiving good results by too much absorbing the sensitive solution, must be\nstarched as before directed, is coated either by brushing or by floating.\nBy the first method a roll of paper five yards long can be prepared\nwithout great trouble, and give, perhaps, better results than if prepared\nby floating; but the latter method is by far the the most convenient: one\ndoes not generally prepare by brushing sheets of paper larger than about\n30×40 inches.\n\nFor brushing, the paper is pinned on a board, then, with a large badger\nbrush dipped in the sensitive solution, the latter is applied as evenly as\npossible; after which, by lightly passing the brush over, the striae are\nremoved, the coating well equalized, and the paper hung up to dry.  The\ncoating should not be very thin, and, above all, not too thick, for then\nit would require an unusually long exposure to allow the light acting\nthrough the whole thickness of the film, which is a sine qua non to obtain\na clear ground, i.e., not stained blue.\n\nTo prepare by floating, pour the solution in a shallow tray, which needs\nnot to be more than 20×34 inches, 30 inches being the width of the drawing\npaper usually employed; then roll the paper and place it on the solution.\nNow, taking hold of it by two corners, draw it out slowly: the paper will\nunroll by itself.  This operation can be done by diffused daylight, but,\nof course, the paper should be dried in a dark room.  It dries rapidly.\nEndless rolls are prepared by machinery.  To expose, the drawing is placed\nin the printing frame, face downwards, and the sensitive paper laid over\nit. The whole is then pressed into contact by interposing a cushion\nbetween the lid of the frame and the paper, and exposed so that the rays\nof light fall _perpendicularly_ upon it.\n\nThe cyanofer preparation is quite sensitive.  From half a minute to two\nminutes exposure, according to the intensity of the light and the\nthickness of the coating, is sufficient in sunshine to reproduce a drawing\nmade on the ordinary tracing paper.  In the shade, by a clear sky, the\nexposure is about five times longer, and varies from half an hour to an\nhour and more in cloudy weather, but then the design is seldom perfectly\nsharp.\n\nThe progresses of the impression is followed by opening one side of the\nprinting frame and examining the proof. The exposure is sufficient when\nthe paper is tinged brown on the parts corresponding to the ground of the\ndesign.  The image appears then negative, that is, yellowish on a tinged\nground.\n\nAnother and more safe method of ascertaining the correct time of exposure,\nwhich can be employed concurrently with the other, is to place a few\nstrips of the same sheet of sensitive paper between the margin of the\ndesign, upon which a few lines have been traced, and the paper, and,\nwithout opening the frame, to draw one of them, from time to time, and dip\nit in the developing solution.  If the whole strip be tinted blue, the\nproof is not sufficiently exposed; but if the lines soon appear with an\nintense coloration on the yellowish ground of the paper, and the latter do\nnot turn blue in a minute, at the most, the exposure is right.  By excess,\nthe lines are with difficulty developed or broken.\n\nFor developing, we provide with three wooden trays lined with lead or\ngutta-percha, or, more economically, coated with yellow wax.  The wax is\nmelted, then applied very hot, and, when it is solidified and quite cold,\nthe coating is equalized with a hot iron, whereby the cracks produced by\nthe contraction of the wax when cooling are filled up.\n\nOne of these trays should contain a layer, about three-quarters of an inch\nthick, of an almost saturated solution of potassium ferrocyanate (the\ndeveloper); the next be filled with water, and the third with water\nacidified by sulphuric acid in the proportion of three per cent. in\nvolumes.\n\nAll this being ready, the margin of the proof is turned upwards—so as to\nform a disk of which the outside is the impressed surface—in order that\nthe ferrocyanate solution does not find its way on the back of the proof,\nwhich would produce stains.  Now the proof is laid, the lower edge first,\non the developer, and gradually lowered upon it, when, taking immediately\nhold of it by the two corners nearest to the body, it is lifted out and\nheld upright to allow one following the development of the image; and,\npresently, if any air-bubbles are seen on the proof, they should at once\nbe touched up with a brush wetted with the ferrocyanate solution; the\nreason explains itself.\n\nThe image appears at once.  As soon as the fine lines are well defined,\nthe blue intense, and, especially, when the ground has a tendency to be\ntinged blue, the proof is placed in the tray filled with water and in this\nturned over two or three times, when it is immersed in the diluted\nsulphuric acid.  In this bath the print acquires a deep blue coloration,\nconsisting of Prussian blue, and the ground becomes tinted with a blue\nprecipitate without adherence, which is easily washed off by throwing the\nliquid on the proof with a wooden spatula, or, better, by rubbing with a\nrag tied to a stick.  When the ground is cleared, and after three or four\nminutes immersion to dissolve the iron salts acted on, the proof is rinsed\nin water several times renewed to free it from acid, and hung to dry.\n\nThere are two causes of failures in this process, viz., over and\nunder-exposure. In the former case the fine lines are broken or washed out\nin clearing the proof (which may also arise from the drawing made with an\nink not opaque enough); in the latter the ground is more or less stained.\n\nThe blue stains, the lines for corrections, etc., are erased with the the\npotassic oxalate (_blue salving,_ as it is termed) whose formula has been\ngiven.\n\nThe additions, corrections and writing are made with a _Prussian blue ink_\nprepared by mixing the two following solutions:\n\nA.   Ferric chloride,   4 parts\n     dry\n     Water              350 parts\nB.   Potassium          15 parts\n     ferrocyanate\n     Water              250 parts\n\nThe precipitate being collected on a filter and washed until the water\ncommences to be tinged blue, is dissolved to the proper consistency in\nabout 400 parts of water. This ink does not corrode steel pens.\n\nIt has been stated that the cyanofer process keeps for years if preserved\nfrom the combined action of dampness and the air.  The writer found in his\npractice that the ferric salts in presence of the organic matters (the\nsizes) acts as does potassium bichromate and renders, in a certain period,\nthe cyanofer film insoluble even after a prolonged insulation.  Paper\nfreshly prepared is always more sensitive and gives better whites and\ngenerally finer results.(10)\n\nThe prints can be toned black in operating as in the cyonotype, but the\nresults are seldom good.\n\nCaptain Pizzighelli’s formula is as follows: Prepare\n\nA.   Gum arabic        15 parts\n     Water             100 parts\nB.   Ammonia ferric    45 parts\n     citrate\n     Water             100 parts\nC.   Ferric chloride   45 parts\n     Water             100 parts\n\nFor sensitizing mix _in order_:\n\nSolution A   100 parts\nSolution B   40 parts\nSolution C   20 parts\n\nThe mixture very much thickens at first, but becomes sufficiently fluid\nfor use in a few hours.  It keeps well for two or three days. Leaving out\nB and replacing it by rain water, this makes also a good solution for the\ncyanotype.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE BLACK OR INK PROCESS. (FERRO-TANNATE PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives black positive impressions on white ground from\npositive clichés, and negative impressions from negative clichés._  It has\nbeen attributed to Mr. Colas, but in reality it was invented by Mr.\nPoitevin, who describes it as follows in his communication of May, 1860,\nto the Société Francaise de Photographie:\n\n“I make a solution containing—”\n\nIron perchloride, cryst   10 parts\nTartaric acid             3 parts\nWater                     100 parts\n\n“I apply the paper on this mixture and let it dry spontaneously in the\ndark, and at the moment of using it I completely desiccate it at a gentle\nheat. Thus prepared the paper is of a deep yellow color.  Light decolors\nit rapidly, and ten or twelve minutes’ exposure through a positive cliché\nsuffices to well impress it, that is, to reduce in the whites the iron\nperchloride to the state of protochloride.”\n\n“To print, one is guided by the decoloration of the paper, and even for\nmore facility I add to the solution of iron perchloride and tartaric acid\na small quantity of a solution of potassium sulphocyanide for the purpose\nof obtaining a red tint, which is more visible and disappears also under\nthe influence of light in proportion to the decomposition of the\nperchloride.  One obtains then after exposure a red design on the white\nground of the paper.  This red color is not permanent.  It even disappears\nby keeping the proof in the dark.”\n\n“To develop and then to fix the design thus obtained I wash rapidly the\npaper in ordinary water, or better, in water holding chalk in suspension.\nThe red coloration disappears, a part of the iron perchloride is washed\nout, and in the parts which have not been acted on by light the\nperchloride is transformed into sesquioxide.  I replace then the water by\nsolution of gallic acid or of tannin and the image progressively appears\nin ink-black.  When I judge the image to be sufficiently intense I wash\nthe proof in rain water, in preference to ordinary water, which might\ncause the gallic acid and tannin to turn brown. I sponge between sheets of\nblotting paper and let the proof dry spontaneously.”\n\n“If in place of gallic acid I use a diluted solution of potassium\nferricyanide (red prussiate of potash), Prussian blue is formed in the\nparts acted on by light.  The preparation is even sensitive enough to\npermit one to obtain an impression in the camera obscura in developing by\nthe ferricyanide.”\n\n“As to the proofs in gallate (or tannate) of iron, they can be transformed\ninto Prussian blue in a solution of potassium ferrocyanide (yellow\nprussiate of potash) slightly acidified by sulphuric acid.”\n\nThe paper most suitable for this process is that which has been previously\nwell sized with starch, as explained in a special paragraph of this\npamphlet. Paper prepared with a film of coagulated albumen gives also good\nresults.  It may be prepared by brushing as well as by floating, but in\neither case the paper should be wetted on the surface only and dried\nrapidly at a temperature of about 115 deg. Fahr. (46 deg. C.) and kept in\na dry place.  It does not keep for more than from ten to fifteen days,\nowing to the hygroscopicity of the iron compound.  Mr. Colas, who prepares\nthe paper for the Parisian market, I think, states that he avoids its\ndeterioration by keeping it wrapped in blotting paper, between two sheets\nof India rubber, to exclude air and dampness.  Silvered albumen and plain\npaper, well desiccated, could be kept in that way for a certain period,\nespecially if the blotting paper is impregnated with sodium bicarbonate\nand well dried.\n\nMr. A. Fisch advises to discard the preliminary washing and to develop\njust on the removal of the proofs from the printing frame.  In operating\nin this manner the development is best made by floating, taking care that\nthe solution does not run off the back of the proof.\n\nThe developer may consist of a dilute solution of nutgalls or of\n\nTannin or gallic acid   4 parts\nOxalic acid             0.15 parts\nWater                   1,000 parts\n\nAfter developing the proof should be washed rapidly—under a jet of water,\nif possible—for were the iron salt and the reagent not soon removed, or\nany remain in the paper, the ground would be tinted violet.  And whatever\nbe the care taken, it very seldom occurs that the whites are pure when the\nproof is dry.  This for half-tone pictures has not a great importance, but\nfor the reproductions of plans it is sometimes objectionable.  In fact it\nmust be acknowledged that none of the processes now at our disposal—if we\nexcept the so-called Artigues process described further on—gives an\nentirely satisfactory result.  A simple and expeditious process, yielding\nintense black impressions on a white ground, is yet to be found for the\nreproduction of plans, maps, etc., without resorting to a negative cliché\nor drawing.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CUPROTYPE. (BURNETT’S PROCESS.)\n\n\n_This process gives positive impressions from negative clichés._\n\nUranic nitrate   10 parts\nCupric nitrate   2 parts\nWater            100 parts\n\nFloat for a minute strong, well-sized paper on this solution and let it\ndry spontaneously in the dark.  Expose until the image is visible, then\ndevelop by floating on a solution of potassium ferricyanide at 5 per 100\nof water—the image appears at once with a rich brown color.  When\ndeveloped, wash it in several changes of water until the unaltered salts\nare eliminated.  The proof is then fixed, and, if too intense, can be\nreduced in water slightly acidified with hydrochloric acid.  A fine black\nimage is obtained by toning in a solution of platinic chloride at 1 per\n100 of water.\n\nThe chemical actions giving rise to the formation of the metallic\nferrocyanide, of which the image consists, are quite complicated.  Under\nthe luminous agency the uranic nitrate is first reduced, then the uranous\noxide acts on the cupric nitrate, forming cupric oxide, which is finally\nreduced to the metallic state.  This metal now converts the ferricyanate\nin the ferro compound, which, by another action, forms both cupric and\nuranic ferrocyanate.\n\nThe following uranium process gives black impressions:\n\nIn a saturated solution of tartaric acid dissolve freshly precipitated\nferric oxide, and keep the solution—ferric tartrate—in the dark.  To\nprepare the sensitizing solution, dissolve 20 parts of uranic nitrate and\nfrom 1 to 3 parts of tartaric acid in 100 parts of water, and add a small\nquantity of ferric tartrate, the proportion varying with the tint desired:\nan excess gives a blue black. With this solution brush the paper over,\nand, when dry, expose under the negative cliché, then develop with a\nsolution of potassium ferricyanate at 4 per 100 of water. To fix, it\nsuffices to wash in water, renewed three or four times.\n\nAs pointed out by Mr. B. J. Burnett (see Introduction), many photographic\nprocesses can be devised by basing them upon the various chemical changes,\nof which uranous oxide, reduced by light from the uranic nitrate or\nsulphate, is susceptible by means of metallic or organic reagents.\n\nIn the Appendix some of the most important processes, with or without\nsilver salts as reagents, will be described.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE ANILINE PROCESS.\n\n\nThe aniline process was published in 1865, by Mr. Willis, the inventor of\nthe platinotype.(11) It is based on the oxidation of aniline by chromic\nacid, thus: A sheet of paper brushed with a solution of potassium\nbichromate and sulphuric acid, dried, and after insolation under a cliché\nexposed to the fumes of aniline which, in reacting with the chromic\ncompound not reduced by light, forms a blue-black image.  _The process\ngives, consequently, a positive impression from a positive cliché._\n\nThere are various methods of operating; we will briefly describe them.\n\n        SENSITISING SOLUTION.\n1.      Potassium            6 parts\n        bichromate\n        Sulphuric acid       6 parts\n        Magnesium chloride   10 parts\n        Water                150 parts\n\nWillis recommended 10 parts of solid phosphoric acid instead of sulphuric\nacid; the latter forms a preparation about twice more rapidly reduced.\n\n2.   Potassium            10 parts\n     bichromate\n     Manganous sulphate   4 parts\n     Potassium            20 parts\n     bisulphate\n     Water                300 parts\n3.   Ammonium             5 parts\n     bichromate\n     Ammonium chloride    5 parts\n     Cupric sulphate      1 part\n     Sulphuric acid       8 parts\n     Water                150 parts\n\nGood well-sized paper should be employed. Rives is too tender and absorbs\ntoo much.  Steinbach is better.  For small sizes, whatever be the paper\nselected, it is well to size it with starch and, if possible, to calender\nit on a hot steel plate, or, in lieu, to iron it.  This is not, however, a\nsine qua non. The paper is sensitized by brushing or by floating.  To\nsensitize by floating, it should be left but for a few seconds on the\nsolution and removed by dragging it on a glass rod in order to remove the\nsuperfluous liquid.  Only the surface of the paper should be impregnated,\notherwise the whites would be more or less tinted and the image imbedded\nnot as sharp.\n\nSensitized, the paper must be dried as rapidly as possible. It does not\nkeep, and should be employed the day it is prepared or the day after,\nkeeping it well wrapped in paper.\n\nAs said above, it is exposed under a positive cliché, plans, designs,\netc., drawn on tracing paper or linen.  The more transparent the material,\nthe more rapid the chemical changes.  During the insolation—and it is very\nshort—the chromic compound is reduced, the parts corresponding to the\nground, that is, the transparent parts of the cliché, are discolored,\nwhile those under the design remain unaltered; the image being, therefore,\nfaintly visible, and being formed of the chromic mixture, it is developed\nby the fumes of aniline in a blue black tone.  Therefore, if the paper be\nnot sufficiently exposed, the ground is colored like the image, although\nnot as deeply, since the dye formed is proportionate to the more or less\nquantity of unreduced compound, and if exposed too long the image is\nimperfectly developed or not at all by excess.\n\nThe discoloration of the ground, which turns to a greenish hue, easily\nindicates when the exposure is sufficient.  But, to ascertain it, the\nbeginner should use _tests_ as in the cyanofer process.  Mr. Endemann\nregulates the time of exposure by partly covering a strip of the sensitive\npaper with a piece of the tracing material upon which the design is made,\nand exposing the whole until the covered part of the paper assumes the\nsame shade as the part directly exposed to light.\n\nTo develop the print is placed in the bottom of a tray, which is then\ncovered with a lid upon which is pinned blotting paper well imbued with an\naniline and benzine mixture, or the reverse; that is, exposing the print\nfastened to the lid and placing the aniline on the bottom of the tray.\nThe tray should be hermetically closed; that is a condition to obtain a\nfine and equal coloration.  For this purpose the lid should be well lined\nwith sheets of blotting paper and a weight placed over it during the\noperation.  Large prints are necessarily developed in a fumigating box\nmade ad hoc.  The aniline solution consists of\n\nAniline (commercial for   8 parts\nred)\nBenzine, rectified        100 parts\n\nIn place of benzine, ether U.S.P., sp. grav. 0.837, may be used.\n\nWhen the proof is not over-exposed the development commences in a few\nminutes.  The image first takes a dirty black olive color which turns blue\nin water, then the tone darkens to a dark-brownish tint.  The time of\nexposure to the aniline fumes depends on the time of insolation; if short,\nthe ground is soon tinted, and consequently the development should then be\nstopped; if over-exposed, the development proceeds slowly.  The darkest\ntone is obtained by a rather full exposure which admits a long fumigation.\nSometimes the image takes a green color; it suffices then to wash the\nproof in water rendered alkaline by a few drops of aqueous ammonia to\nobtain the normal color.\n\nTo somewhat improve the tone of the image and, if objectionable, to remove\nthe chromic oxide which tinges the ground greenish, the proof should be\nimmersed in a dilute solution of sulphuric acid 1:100, then washed twice,\nand finally passed in ammoniacal water 1:100.\n\nMr. Hermann Endemann has published, in 1866, the following process in the\n_Journal of the American Chemical Society_, pp. 189 et seq.:\n\nThe paper, which must be well sized with glue, 1:50, is sensitized with\nthe following solution and exposed when dry, but still slightly damp:\n\nA.   Potassium         1 ounce or 480\n     bicarbonate       parts\n     Salt              1 ounce or 480\n                       parts\n     Sodium vanadate   2/3 grain or 0.66\n                       part\n     Water             20 ounces or 9,600\n                       parts\nB.   Sulphuric acid    2 ounces or 960\n                       parts\n     Water             10 ounces or 4,800\n                       parts\n\nWhen cold mix to A.\n\n“From the composition of the solution,” says Mr. Endemann, “it is evident\nthat it must be strongly acid; but when this solution is exposed to light,\nin the presence of the organic substances of the paper, the acidity of the\nsolution disappears, we obtain potassium and sodium sulphates, basic\nchromium sulphate, salt and vanadic acid.  While, therefore, the unchanged\nparts of the paper remain acid, the changed parts acquire a neutral\nreaction, and while the first will readily assimilate bases, the second\nwill not.  Exposed in an atmosphere laden with water and aniline, the\naniline will be absorbed in those parts where the solution remains acid\nand in proportion to the remaining acidity.”\n\nTo develop the image the paper is spread over the opening of a frame\ntightly placed on a pan, in the bottom of which is heated a solution of\naniline in water, 1:50, until the image appears brown, and for further\ndevelopment in a box laden with steam water, which, according to Mr.\nEndemann, requires two hours to obtain a deep black coloration.  To remove\nthe chromium compound the picture is immersed in a solution of aqueous\nammonia, 1:6, then washed and dried.\n\nA few years ago the aniline process was improved by developing the image\nwith the aniline-benzine mixture vaporized by steam in a box made\nspecially for that purpose, whereby a reproduction can be obtained in less\nthan ten minutes.\n\nIn the photographic department of Messrs Poulson & Eger’s Hecia\nArchitectural and Ornamental Iron Works, which is directed by Charles\nBilordeaux, this process is worked in the following manner:\n\nThe developing is made of sheet iron with a door sliding up and down, it\nbeing balanced by a counterpoise, and provided with a chimney.  In the box\nis a gutter, extending the whole length of the bottom, covered with muslin\nand connected to a steam pipe; there is also a coil similarly connected.\nAfter the insolation, which requires about one minute in sunshine, the\nprint is suspended in the box, the muslin brushed over with the solution\nof aniline, and live steam allowed to pass through the gutter for only two\nminutes, whereby the aniline being vaporized acts on the chromic salt and\ndevelops the image; then the steam is allowed in the coil, and, in from\nthree to four minutes, the paper is dry and the picture finished. The\nimage stands on a slightly greenish ground, which is not objectionable for\nthe purpose the reproductions are made.\n\nThe sensitizing solution is similar to that published by Mr. Endemann,\nviz.:\n\nPotassium bichromate   460 grams\nSodium chloride        460 grams\nAmmonium vanadate      0.75 gram\nSulphuric acid         1 liter\nWater                  13 liters\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE PRIMULINE OR DIAZOTYPE PROCESS.\n\n\nPrimuline, discovered in 1887 by Mr. A. G. Green, an English chemist, is a\ndye of a primrose color, possessing a great affinity for cotton fibers, to\nwhich it is readily fixed by simply immersing the material for a few\nmoments in a hot solution of the dye.  If the material so dyed be placed\nin an acidified solution of nitrous oxide, the primuline is diazotized,\nforming a derivative compound of a deeper color, which fades in the light,\nand which in presence of amines and phenols gives rise to a variety of\ndyes whose color depends on the reagent employed, while, when acted on by\nlight, the resulting compound is entirely deprived of this property.  In\nother words, the diazotized primuline acts as a mordant only when not\naltered by the luminous action.\n\nThe chemical change light effects in the diazotized primuline is not well\nknown.  It is pretty certain, however, that nitrogen is set free, for if\ngelatine imbued with primuline be immersed in water after insulation,\nnitrogen is set free and can be collected as usual in a tub filled with\nwater and inverted on the substance.\n\nBy itself diazotized primuline is slowly influenced by light, but quickly\nacted on in presence of organic substances.  It is more sensitive when\napplied on cotton or paper than on wool, silk, linen, and such organic\ncompounds as gelatine, albumen, caseine, starch, etc.  Its sensitiveness\nis about one-tenth less with gelatine than with cotton.\n\nThe sensitiveness of diazotized primuline to light, when united to organic\nsubstances and the different colors which can be obtained with the\nunaltered compound, have given rise to an interesting printing method, the\ninvention of Messrs. A. G. Green, C. F. Cross, and E. J. Bevan, which\nyields _positive impressions from positive clichés_.  The manipulations of\nthe process are simple:\n\nIn a certain quantity of rain water, kept at nearly the boiling\ntemperature by an alcohol lamp placed under the vessel, dissolve per cent.\n2 parts of commercial primuline, and in this immerse, by means of a glass\nrod, some pieces of calico—free from dressing—turning them over several\ntimes during the immersion.  When the fibers are well imbued, which\nrequires from four to five minutes, remove the calico with the glass rod\nand rinse it thoroughly in water.  This done, wring out the superfluous\nliquid as much as possible, and, finally, immerse each piece separately in\na solution of\n\nSodium nitrite,      7 parts\ncommercial\nHydrochloric acid,   16  parts\ncommercial\nWater                100 parts\n\nAfter turning the pieces of calico two or three times over, they are\nrinsed to eliminate the acid, then drained and placed between sheets of\nblotting paper to dry.  All this, except the impregnation with primuline,\nshould be done in the dark room.\n\nAs said above, primuline is transformed by nitrous oxide into a diazotized\ncompound, and consequently the material is now susceptible of being acted\non by light.  It does not keep, and should be exposed, etc., soon after\nits preparation.\n\nPaper is impregnated with primuline either by floating or brushing.  The\nbest results are obtained with paper previously sized with arrowroot or\ngelatine in order to keep the image entirely on the surface of the paper.\n\nLinen, silk and wool are treated as calico.\n\nThe clichés should be positive to obtain positive expressions and somewhat\nmore opaque than those employed in the processes before described, else\nvigor and intensity could not be obtained.  Here we must state that the\nprimuline process seems to be better adapted for the reproductions of\ndrawings, such as made for the black process, and of opaque photo-clichés\nin lines, or white and black, than for printing in half tone.\n\nWhen the material to print upon is thick and wholly impregnated with\ndiazotized primuline, it is advisable, since the insulation could not be\nprolonged to effect the change through, to expose the back of the material\nfor a certain but short period in order to _clear_ it.  This is especially\nadvantageous when the cliché is not of good intensity.\n\nDuring the exposure, which varies from 30 seconds to 10 minutes and more\nby a dull light, the progresses of the luminous action is seen by the\nbleaching of the material which assumes a dingy coloration.  But in order\nto ascertain when the decomposition is complete on the ground of the\nimage, it is well to use _tests_ as in the cyanofer process, dipping one\nof them in the developer from time to time.\n\nThe developers are compounded as follows:\n\n         FOR RED.\nBeta-naphthol     4 parts\nCaustic potassa   6 parts\nWater             500 parts\n\nRub the alkali and the naphthol with a little water in a mortar and add\nthe remainder of the water.\n\n    FOR ORANGE.\nResorcin   3 parts\nWater      500 parts\n\nWhen dissolved add\n\nCaustic potassa   5 parts\n\n          FOR YELLOW.\nCarbolic acid, cryst   5 parts\nWater                  500 parts\n\n          FOR PURPLE.\nNaphthylamine           6 parts\nHydrochloric acid, in   6 parts\nvolume\n\nMix in a mortar, then add\n\nWater   500 parts\n\n             FOR BLACK.\nEikonogen, white crystals   6 parts\nWater                       500 parts\n\nPulverize the eikonogen, add the water and, at the same time, the material\non its removal from the printing frame, and keep in motion until the\ndevelopment is effected.\n\n      FOR BROWN.\nPyrogallol   5 parts\nWater        500 parts\n\nAfter the development, which requires but a few moments, it suffices to\nwash the material to fix the image by eliminating the soluble compounds.\nHowever, for purple the material should be passed in a dilute solution of\ntartaric acid and not washed afterwards; it should remain acid.\n\nWhen it is desirable to obtain an impression in several colors, the\nvarious developers are thickened with starch, then locally applied with a\nbrush on the image, which is always visible after exposure.\n\nFor printing on wood, glass and porcelain, see further on.\n\n\n\n\n\n            PRINTING ON WOOD, CANVAS, OPAL, AND TRANSPARENCIES\n\n\n_Printing on Wood._—To print on a wood block a design to be engraved on\nthe same presents certain difficulties.  In the first place, the\nsensitizing solution must not be absorbed by the wood, but remain wholly\non its surface; then the photo film, although thick enough to produce an\nimage sufficiently intense to be distinctly visible in all its details,\nshould not scale or clip away under the graver, and not interfere in any\nway with the work of the artist; the least touch of the graver must reach\nthe wood and make its impression.  Lastly, the design should be permanent.\nThese difficulties will be avoided by adhering to the instructions given\nin the lines following.\n\nThe solution to render impervious the surface of the wood consists of\n\nCommon gelatine   5 parts\nGum arabic        3 parts\nCastile soap      3 parts\nWater             100 parts\n\nDissolve by heat on a water bath.\n\nTo apply it, the wood is rubbed with fine sandpaper, then heated over a\nspirit lamp to about 86 deg. Fahr. (30 deg. C.) and upon it is poured in\nexcess the liquefied and quite warm solution, which must be allowed to\npenetrate in the pores of the wood by letting it gelatinize, when it is\nwiped off clean.  Nothing must remain on the surface of the wood. This\ndone, and while still damp, the preparation is rendered insoluble by\npouring over a solution of alum at 5 per 100 of water.  The object of this\npreliminary operation is to render the wood impervious, and therefore to\nprevent the sensitizing solution to penetrate its texture.  The wood is\nthen heated again and its surface whitened with a little silver white or\nsulphate of barium, diffused in a small quantity of the following warm\nsolution:\n\nGelatine   1 parts\nAlum       0.1 part\nWater      100 parts\n\nWhile wet, this is smoothed with a jeweler’s brush, taking care to leave\non the wood, a very thin layer of the mixture, only sufficient to obtain a\nwhite surface which, by contrasting with color of the wood assists the\nengraver in his work.  The wood should now be allowed to dry thoroughly,\nwhen it is coated with a tepid solution of\n\nIsinglass   3 parts\nWater       100 parts\n\nand dried.\n\nNow the sensitizing process differs according as whether the cliché is\npositive or negative.  In the former case the preparation is sensitized\nwith the solution employed in the black process, proceeding afterwards as\nusual; in the latter, that is, when the cliché is negative, the best\nprocess is the cuprotype.(12)\n\nFor printing, special frames are employed to permit one to examine the\nprogress of the impression from time to time without the possibility of\neither the wood block or the cliché moving.  These frames open in two.\nThe upper frame is provided with screws on the four sides to hold firmly\nthe block when it is placed into contact with the cliché by means of the\nscrews fixed on the cross bars.  As to the cliché, if it is made on a\nglass plate, it is secured on the thick glass plate of the lower frame by\ntwo wooden bars against it pushed by screws.\n\nWhen the block is ready for printing, the prepared side is usually\nconcave.   It is straightened by slightly wetting the back and resting it\non one end, prepared side against the wall.\n\n_Printing on Canvas.—_The canvas should be first brushed with a solution\nof aqueous ammonia in alcohol, 1:3, to remove greasiness until the thread\njust commences to show, then, when rinsed and dry, rubbed with fine sand\nto give a tooth, dusted, washed with a sponge and then coated with the\nfollowing solution, proceeding afterwards as in the cuprotype process:\n\nIsinglass        8 parts\nUranic nitrate   5 parts\nCopper nitrate   2 parts\nWater            200 parts\n\n_Printing on Opal, Celluloid, etc._, is quite simple; it suffices to coat\nthe material with the following gelatine solution, and, when the film is\ndry, to proceed in operating by any one of the processes before described.\n\nThe sensitizing compound may be incorporated to the gelatine solution, but\nwe prefer not to do it and to sensitize the plates as they are wanted for\nuse.\n\nA.   Gelatine   4 parts\n     Water      70 parts in volume\n\nDissolve and mix little by little in order:\n\nB.   Chrome alum   0.25 parts\n     Water, hot    20 parts\nC.   Alcohol       10 parts\n\nWhen coated place the plates on a level stand until the gelatine is set,\nand let them dry on a rack.\n\n_Transparencies._—Prepare the plate as directed above with\n\nA.   Gelatine      6 parts\n     Water         70 parts\nB.   Chrome alum   0.3 part\n     Water, hot    20 parts\nC.   Alcohol       10 parts\n\nSensitize with the uranic-copper solution employed in the cuprotype.  By\nthis process transparencies of a rich brown, not actinic, color are\nobtained.  Consequently they can be used to reproduce negatives by the\nsame process.  For lantern slides they may be toned black by platinic\nchloride.\n\nTo strip off the picture, apply, first, on the glass plate a substratum of\nIndia rubber, 2 to 100 of benzole, coat with plain collodion, immerse the\nplate in water as soon as the film is set, and when greasiness has\ndisappeared pour on the gelatine solution and proceed.\n\nFor tranferring on any material, a sheet of paper is immersed in a\nsolution of India rubber cement in 20 parts of benzole, dried, coated with\nthe gelatine solution, sensitized, etc., by operating in the ordinary\nmanner.  After development, the proof, being dry, is brushed over with\nalumed gelatine moderately warm, dried, immersed in tepid water until the\ngelatine is softened and tacky, when it is placed on the material and\nsqueezed into contact.  This done, the transfer should be allowed to dry\nthoroughly.  Now, by imbuing the proof with benzole to dissolve the India\nrubber, the paper is easily stripped off, leaving behind the picture\nadhering to the material.\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACING PROCESS ON METAL.\n\n\nWe call the attention of metal engravers to this process.  It is well\nknown that wood engravers have their original designs photographed on the\nblock in order to save considerable time by not making the drawing\nthemselves; moreover the cost is nominal, so to say, and the copy more\ntrue and perfect than it can be done by hand.  Why should not the copper\nengraver and the aquafortist avail themselves of the same advantages?  A\nfew do it secretly, no doubt, but the generality not knowing the process,\nor, if so, not having tried it, think it is not possible or that it may\nspoil their plates.  This is an error.  It can be done and very easily by\nadhering to the following instructions:\n\nDissolve 2 parts of ammonium bichromate in 100 parts of water, and in this\nlet soak for an hour or so 10 parts of Coignet’s best gelatine, then\ndissolve on a water bath, filter through flannel, and the solution is\nready for use.\n\nBefore being coated, the plate should necessarily be cleaned free from\noxidation and greasy matters.  This is done by immersing the plate for a\nfew moments in a warm solution of common potash, then rinsing and rubbing\nit with chalk moistened with a little water, when after rinsing again and\ndraining the plate should be immediately prepared.\n\nTo spread the gelatine solution in an even and thin layer, a tournette is\nemployed.  The most simple consists of a round wooden stick of which the\nupper part is carved in the form of a cup with an edge, or rim, about one\nquarter of an inch broad.  On this rim is melted some gutta-percha, upon\nwhich the plate is pressed into contact and adhers quite firmly when the\ngutta-percha is solidified.  The stick is perforated at the lower end and\nrevolves on an iron pivot fixed at the bottom of the support, being held\nin the opening on the platform of the same, as shown in the diagram on the\nfollowing page.\n\nThe plate being fastened to the tournette, the warm gelatine solution is\nflowed over it and spread to the edges by means of a glass rod or a piece\nof cardboard, avoiding air bubbles.  This done the tournette is set into\nmotion, and when the film is equalized, which is done in a moment, the\nplate is detached, placed on a leveled stand and slowly dried with the\nspirit lamp.\n\n                              [A Tournette]\n\nBy a good light the exposure on the shade does not exceed twenty minutes\nwith a pretty intense transparency, and should be regulated with a\nphotometer.  When the insulation is sufficient, the image is slightly\nvisible, and should be so.  The plate is then bordered with banking wax\nand bitten-in with a solution of ferric chloride at 45 deg. Baumé, or—\n\nFerric chloride, crystal   20 parts\nHydrochloric acid          1 part\nWater                      100 parts\n\nThe parts of the gelatine film the most acted on are impermeable, so to\nsay, and consequently do not allow the etching fluid to penetrate to the\ncopper; while those the least impressed are permeated according as to\ntheir degree of insolation, Therefore, when the ferric chloride solution\nis poured upon the film and carefelly brushed over with a soft brush, in a\nfew moments the image progressively appears, the deep blacks first, then\nthe half tints, and lastly the most delicate details, the whole requiring\nbut a few minutes. It is now that the etching action should be stopped by\nwashing under the tap.  However, should by excess of exposure, or any\nother cause, the details not appear within five or six minutes, the ferric\nchloride should nevertheless be washed off, for then it may find its way\nunder the film and the plate would be spoiled.  After washing the gelatine\nis dissolved in a solution of potash, etc., when the image would be found\nslightly engraved.\n\nShould the image be in half-tints, it would be advisable to apply a grain\nof rosin on the gelatine film just before etching.  To engrave on steel\nthe operations are the same, but on its removal from the printing frame\nthe plate should be soaked with water renewed several times until the\nbichromate is washed off.  The film is then dried spontaneously and\nafterwards flowed for about two minutes with the Solution A, then, this\nbeing thrown away, with the Solution B, which is allowed to act for a\nsimilar period.\n\nA.   Nitric acid, pure   120 parts\n     Silver nitrate      6 parts\n     Alcohol, 95 deg     50 parts\n     Water               75 parts\nB.

Pale\nblue is a very actinic color which is not reproduced in photography,\nexcept by the ortho-chromatic process, or if it does, the impression being\nvery weak, is not objectionable.  When the image has not been sufficiently\nor not at all bleached, the blue is dissolved by an alcoholized solution\nof the blue solving.\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE URANOTYPE.\n\n\nThis process, devised by J. Wothly, in 1864, did not receive from the\nphotographers the attention it merits, as it is always the case when a\nprocess is patented, and can be replaced by another equally practical\nwhich is not.  It gives pictures of a very good tone, which are quite\npermanent; we have some made in 1866, which are suffered no change\nwhatever, they seem to have been printed from yesterday.\n\nThe first process given by Wothly does not appear to be complete.  It has\nbeen well described by H. Cooper and a gentleman who signs by the initial\nletter X.\n\nThe process published in 1865 by Wothly is as follows: A sheet of paper is\nsized by brushing with a paste made of 24 parts of arrowroot in 500 parts\nof water, to which are added a few drops of a solution of citric or\ntartaric acid, then coated with a collodion consisting of 100 cubic\ncentimeters of plain collodion, a few drops of oil of turpentine and 30\ncubic centimeters of the following sensitizing solution:\n\nNitrate of uranium     30 to 90 parts\nChloride of platinum   2 parts\nAlcohol                180 parts\n\nThe time of exposure is about that required for paper prepared with silver\nchloride.  The image is bluish-black but weak.  After washing the print is\nimmersed in a solution containing 0.5 parts of chloride of gold for 2,000\nparts of distilled water, and then fixed in a bath of sulphocyanate of\npotassium, which tones the image blue-black.\n\nIt may happen that the proof is slightly tinted red. This arises from a\nsmall quantity of lime in the paper which forms uranate of calcium.\n\nTo prevent the proofs turning yellow, it should be washed in an\nexceedingly weak solution of acetic acid.\n\nIf, after exposure, the print is immersed, without it being washed, in the\ngold bath, the image becomes rose-red, but the whites remain pure. The\neffect is peculiar.\n\n\n\n\n                       H. COOPER’S PROCESS (1865).\n\n\n     PREPARATION OF THE PAPER\nSt. Vincent arrowroot   200 grains\nBoiling water           10 ounces\n\nCrush the arrowroot to fine powder, then rub it to a paste with a little\nwater, and let an assistant pour a few drams of boiling water while you\nkeep stirring all the time; finally, let him add the rest of the boiling\nwater, the operator still continuing the stirring.  The paste is allowed\nto cool, and will be thicker when cold than when hot.  Remove the upper\nportion entirely when quite cold, otherwise, if any left, it will give\nrise to streaks.  The author insists upon the necessity of all these\ncares.  Two sheets of paper are now placed side by side on a flat board,\nthen the surface of the first is covered with the paste by means of a\nsponge, proceeding, before you leave it, all over the sheet in a\nhorizontal direction; the second sheet is covered in a like manner.  By\nthe time the second sheet is pasted, the first one will be partially dry.\nThe sponge is now drawn over each sheet, in succession, in a perpendicular\ndirection in order to efface the streaks from the first sponging.  If the\npaste drags in a slimy manner, it is too strong, and a fresh arrowroot\nmust be prepared, because dilution only ends in failure.  Why dry, the\npaper is rolled under moderate pressure, and when it lies smoothly the\nmaximum pressure may be applied.\n\n   PLAIN COLLODION.\nAlcohol      12 ounces\nEther        4 ounces\nPyroxyline   80 grains\n\n       SENSITIVE COLLODION.\nPlain collodion            1 ounce\nNitrate of uranium, pure   30 grains\nNitrate or silver          5 grains\n\nAdd the uranium first, and as soon as it has dissolved all that it can,\nadd a grain or two of soda, and when settled pour off the supernatant\ncollodion and add the silver.(14) To coat the paper with collodion, use a\nboard with a handle beneath, such as is used by plasterers.  On this place\na sheet of paper, the edges being turned up about the sixteenth of an\ninch; this enables the whole of the sheet to be covered without spilling\nthe collodion or allowing it to run on the back of the paper.\n\nThere is a marked difference in the appearance of the prints when they\nleave the pressure frame. Some samples of collodion cause the picture to\nprint of a beautiful green, others of a rich brown, and some of a yellow\nor orange tint.  The last take the longest of all to tone, and difficultly\nassume the tint of well toned silver prints,(15) those printing to green\nor brown tone very rapidly.\n\nAfter printing the pictures are placed in diluted sulphuric acid, 1 to 30\nof water, until the high lights are perfectly clear and white; this takes\nfrom ten to fifteen minutes.  After washing well under a stream of water,\nthey are placed in the toning and fixing bath.\n\n         TONING AND FIXING BATH.\nSulphocyanide of ammonium   1 ounce\nWater                       12 ounces\nChloride of gold            1 to 3 grains\n\nAfter removing from this bath, the prints are immersed for a few moments\nin water, and then rapidly washed.\n\n    FORMULA FOR PREPARING THE PYROXYLINE\nNitric acid, sp. gr. 1.30   12 fluid ounces\nSulphuric acid, sp. gr.     36 fluid ounces\n1.845\nWater                       8 fluid ounces\nTemperature                 130 degrees Fahr.\nTime of immersion           15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n              X’S PROCESS (1865).

Let settle the\nprecipitate, decant, and wash in several changes of water.  Dissolve it by\nheat in pure nitric acid, _taking care not to add an excess of acid._  The\nammonio-nitrate of uranium salt is then crystallized and dried.

It has been described theoretically and practically\nby Pizzighelli and Kübl in a paper for which the Vienna Photographic\nSociety has awarded the Voightlander prize.(17) The following is an\nabridgment of this important process, as described by the authors:\n\nThe paper, calendered or not,(18) is sized with gelatine or arrowroot.\nThe color of the proof with the latter size is brownish black, and bluish\nblack with the former.\n\nTo prepare the gelatine solution 10 parts of gelatine are soaked in 800\nparts of water and then dissolved at a temperature of 60 deg. C. (140 deg.\nFahr.), when 200 parts of alcohol and 3 parts of alum are added and the\nsolution filtered.\n\nTo prepare the arrowroot solution 10 parts of the substance are powdered\nin a mortar with a little water and mixed to 800 parts of boiling water,\nadded gradually in stirring.  After boiling for a few minutes 200 parts of\nalcohol are added and the mixture filtered.\n\nThese solutions are employed warm.  The paper is immersed for two or three\nminutes and hung up to dry in a heated room, then immersed a second time\nand dried by hanging it up in the opposite direction, in order to obtain\nan even coating.\n\nThe potassic platinic chloride is an article of commerce.  It should be\nsoluble without residue in 6 parts of water and without acid reaction.  In\nthis proportion it constitutes the normal stock solution employed in the\nvarious formulas.\n\nThe standard ferric oxalate solution is also found in commerce. Treated by\npotassium ferricyanate it should not be colored blue, nor become turpid\nwhen diluted with one-tenth part of water and boiled.  The former reaction\nindicates that it contains no ferrous salt, and the latter no basic\noxalate.\n\nThe authors give the following instructions for preparing the ferric\noxalate solution, to which they attach much importance:\n\nFive hundred parts of ferric chloride are dissolved in 5,000 parts of\nwater and heated to boiling, when a solution of soda is added until the\nliquid becomes alkaline.(19) About 250 parts of caustic soda are generally\nemployed for this purpose.  The precipitate—ferric oxide—is now washed in\nwarm water until the last washing water is quite neutral to test paper,\nthen drained and mixed with 200 parts of pure crystallized oxalic acid.\nThe mixture is then allowed to stand in the dark for several days at a\ntemperature not exceeding 30 deg. C. (86 deg. Fahr.)  At first the\nsolution from green turns to a yellow green, and finally becomes almost\nbrown.  At this moment the excess of ferric oxide is filtered out and the\nliquor submitted to a quantitative analysis, the result of which leads to\nascertain the quantity of ferric oxalate in 100 parts of the solution and\nthe excess of oxalic acid.  The solution should then be diluted with\ndistilled water, such as it contains 20 parts of ferric oxalate per 100\nparts of water, and oxalic acid must be added in the proportion of from 6\nto 8 per 100 of the ferric oxalate, taking into account the quantity of\nacid the solution already contains.

It is altered by light.(20)\n\n       IRON CHLORATE SOLUTION\nFerric oxalate solution   100  parts\nPotassium chlorate        0.4 parts\n\nThis solution is employed to obtain more contrasts.\n\n  PREPARATION OF THE SENSITIZING SOLUTION\nPlatinum solution         12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution   11 parts\nDistilled water           2 parts\n\nThis solution gives very soft tones with intense black.  To obtain more\nbrilliancy we use the following proportions:\n\nPlatinum solution           12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution     9 parts\nChlorate of iron solution   3 parts\nDistilled water             2 parts\n\nTo obtain results comparable to those which the silver printing out\nprocess gives, the following mixture is employed:\n\nPlatinum solution           12 parts\nFerric oxalate solution     8 parts\nChlorate of iron solution   4 parts\nDistilled water             8 parts\n\nFor very weak negatives, reproductions of drawings, etc., we use—\n\nPlatinum solution   12 parts\nChlorate of iron    11 parts\nDistilled water     2 parts(21)\n\nTo obtain proofs not completely black, as, for example, reproductions of\nlead drawings, the solution may be diluted with half or the whole volume\nof distilled water.  But if the solution be applied on little absorbent\nsurfaces or on paper strongly sized it is not advisable to dilute it.\n\n_Preparation, of the Paper.—_The paper should be kept slightly moist in\norder that it does not too completely absorb the sensitizing solution.\nTherefore, when the atmosphere is very dry, it is well to keep the paper\nin a damp place, in the cellar for example.  Before sensitizing, which\nshould be done by a very diffused light, a quantity of the solution\nproportionate to the surface to be sensitized (about 15 c.c., for a whole\nsheet of Rives’ or Saxe paper) must be measured, and spread with a large\nbrush(22) on the paper fixed with drawing pins on a board covered with a\nsheet of blotting paper.  When well impregnated, the paper is hung up to\ndry in the dark room, and as soon as the apparent dampness of the surface\nhas disappeared, it should be dried immediately at a temperature of 30—40\ndeg. C. (86—101 deg. Fahr).  If the paper be dried too rapidly the\nsensitive compound remains on its surface, and in developing the image\ndoes not come out well.  If, on the other hand, the drying is too slow,\nthe solution penetrates too much in the paper and the image is wanting of\nvigor and does not appear very sharp.  One cannot depart from this rule\nthat the desiccation from the moment the solution has been applied until\nthe paper is dry should last no more than from twelve to fifteen minutes.\n\nThe sensitized paper is hygroscopic and must be preserved in a calcium\nbox.  _It is a conditio sine qua non that the paper must be quite dry\nbefore, during, and after printing, to obtain good results._  Dampness is\nthe greatest enemy in this process.\n\nFor printing a pad of India rubber should be placed over the platinum\npaper to prevent it from attracting the atmospheric moisture, and in damp\nweather it is even advisable to cover it with several sheets of blotting\npaper previously heated before the fire.\n\nThe platinum paper is at least three times more sensitive than the silver\npaper used in the printing-out process, under the reductive action of\nlight the yellow color of the prepared paper turns brown and then becomes\nof a lighter color, nearly orange, so that the darker parts of the image\noften appears more luminous than the dark half tints.  No rule can be\ngiven to regulate the insolation, but after a few trials it is easy to\njudge when it is right by observing the progress of the reduction and the\ncolor of the image. The orange color indicates the complete reduction of\nthe ferric oxalate.  When the details in the lights are _faintly_ visible,\nthe exposure is generally right.\n\nThe developer consists of an almost saturated solution of potassium\noxalate _acidified by oxalic acid,_ and for use heated to 80—85 deg. 0.\n(176—184 deg. Fahr.),(23) in an agate glazed iron tray placed upon a water\nbath at the above temperature. By simply drawing the proof over it, the\nimage is at once developed.(24)\n\nWhen the proof is thought to be over-exposed, the oxalate solution can be\nemployed at a lower temperature.  If, on the contrary, it is\nunder-exposed, the solution may be heated even to the boiling point.\n\nThe developer can be used over and over again.  _It should always have an\nacid reaction._\n\nAccording to Mr. Borlinetto a sepia tone is obtained by using the\nfollowing cold developer:\n\nSaturated solution of   120   parts\npotassium oxalate\nSaturated solution of   13   parts\ncopper chloride\nOxalic acid             1.5 part\n\nAfter developing the proofs are _immediately_ immersed for fixing in a\nsolution of hydrochloric acid, 1 to 80 of water, renewed so long as the\npaper is tinged yellow (about three times), leaving the proofs ten minutes\nin each solution.  Lastly, they are washed to remove the acid.\n\nThe platinotype has been still improved by Captain Pizzighelli, who\ndevised the following methods of operating by which the impressions are\nobtained by the continuous action of light, that is, without development,\nthus rendering the platinotype just as simple as the ordinary printing-out\nsilver process.\n\nIn these new processes to the sensitizing solution is added the alkaline\noxalate, which effects the reduction of the platinous salt during the\nexposure to light.  Consequently the prepared paper is insolated until the\nimage appears as it should be, or—which is exceedingly useful in cloudy\nweather—until it is entirely visible but still deficient in delicate half\ntones, for in the dark the action proceeds and the image developing itself\nwill be found finished in a period which may extend to a few hours.  But\nit can be, however, developed in a few seconds by immersion in a cold or\nslightly warm solution of sodium carbonate, 1:25 of water. The image is\nfixed as directed in the foregoing process.\n\nThe paper, prepared exactly as in the former process and kept in the\ncalcium box until wanted for use, should not be employed quite dry, but\nallowed to absorb a little moisture by hanging it in the dark room.\nHence, the India rubber and other protecting pads can be dispensed with.\nThey are even objectionable, for dampness is absolutely necessary to\npromote the chemical changes by which the image is developed.\n\n    A.

SODIO-FERRIC OXALATE SOLUTION\nFerric oxalate solution   100 parts\nNeutral sodium oxalate    15 to 18 parts\n\nTo prepare these two solutions the ammonium or sodium oxalate is dissolved\nby small quantities at a time, and when the emerald color due to the\nformation of the double oxalate commences to darken, the saturation being\nthen complete, no more of either salt should be added.  The solution is\nnow well shaken with 3 parts of glycerine, allowed to settle and filtered.\n\nAny one of the double oxalates can be used.  The ammonium tends to produce\nsofter pictures and bluish tones.  To obtain more contrasts a little\npotassium chlorate may be added.\n\n   C.

The solutions do not keep.  The paper prepared by\neither one of these two processes can be exposed as in the _old_ process,\nand the image developed bythe hot oxalate solution.\n\nThe preparation of wood, canvas, etc., for the platinotype printing need\nnot to be described; it suggests itself.\n\n\n\n\n                           CAUSES OF FAILURES.\n\n\n_The images are veiled._\n\nThis defect may result from various causes, viz.:\n\n 1st. The stock ferric oxalate solution is impaired by a partial reduction\n      of the ferric salt into ferrous oxalate.  The solution should be\n      preserved in an orange colored vial, and kept in the closet of the\n      dark room.  It should be tested from time to time for the ferrous\n      salt with a solution of potassium ferricyanate.  If it does not\n      contain any ferrous oxalate it can be used by adding to it a little\n      of the iron chlorate solution.\n  2d. The paper has been exposed to light during the sensitizing or the\n      subsequent operations.  One should bear in mind that the platinum\n      paper is twice more sensitive than silvered paper.\n  3d. The sensitized paper has been dried at a temperature above 40 deg.\n      C. (104. deg. Fahr.)\n 4th. Over-exposure.\n\n_The proofs are not sharp._\n\n 1st. The sensitive paper has absorbed moisture.\n  2d. It is too old.  The paper cannot be kept good for over six weeks,\n      unless special care be taken.\n\nAccording to Mr. Bory, the sensitive paper altered by keeping is restored\nto its original good quality by simply brushing it over with a solution of\n0.05 parts of potassium chloride or the same quantity of potassium\nchlorate in 100 parts of distilled water, or a mixture of these two\nsolutions, or one of iron chlorate.\n\nBy treating the insolated paper with these solutions, the image is\ndestroyed, and the paper can be used again.  One operates as for\nsensitizing, taking care to desiccate the paper, as it has been directed.\n\n_The proofs are brilliant during the development, but become dull in\ndrying._\n\nThe paper not well sized. It has been dried too slowly.\n\nRemember that it should be quite desiccated within fifteen minutes.\n\n_The paper is more or less yellow._\n\n 1st. The paper tinted with ultramarine.\n  2d. The sensitizing solution or the developer are not sufficiently acid.\n  3d. The washing (fixing) in the solution of hydrochloric acid was not\n      sufficient to eliminate the iron salts from the paper.\n\n_The proofs harsh, devoid of half tones._\n\n 1st. The sensitizing solution contains too much iron chlorate.\n  2d. Exposure too short.\n\n_The paper is stained._\n\nThe brush not kept clean while sensitizing.\n\n_Black spots._\n\nThey are generally due to metallic dust in the paste of the paper, or from\nparticles of undissolved salt in the platinite solution.\n\nNB: No good results can be expected unless the paper be kept absolutely\ndry before, during and after exposure, when using the former (original)\nprocess.\n\nImpaired sensitiveness of the paper, want of vigor, tinged whites,\nmuddiness, indicate dampness.\n\n\n\n\nARTIGUES’ PROCESS\n\n\nThe Artigues process, so called, is, without any doubt, the best to be\nemployed for the reproduction of plans and drawings in lines.  It is\nsimple, expeditious, and yields black impressions on a very pure white\nground which are absolutely permanent.  And this is of the utmost\nimportance when the copies are to be used for military purpose, or kept in\narchives, such as those of the Patent Office, for example.  Should it not\nrequire the use of negative clichés, it would certainly supersede any of\nthe processes previously described; moreover, as it will be seen, it can\nbe employed for many other purposes than that of obtaining duplicates from\noriginal drawings.  The objection is not even very great indeed, for the\ndesign can be, without great trouble, transformed into a negative by the\naniline method described in the beginning of this work.\n\nThe Artigues process is an adaptation for the purposes in question of the\ncarbon process invented by Poitevin.  We shall describe it in extenso.\n\nThe paper can be prepared with any one of the following solutions:\n\n 1st. Dissolve 2½ parts of ammonium bichromate and 5 parts of best gum\n      arabic in 15 parts of water and neutralize with a few drops of\n      concentrated aqueous ammonia; then add 100 parts in volume of whites\n      of egg and a certain quantity of thick India ink, and, this done,\n      beat the whole to a thick froth.  In ten or twelve hours the albumen\n      will be deposited and ready for use.\n\n      The quantity of India ink added to the albumen should be such as the\n      paper be black when coated, but, however, sufficiently transparent\n      for one to see the shadow of objects placed on the back of it, and\n      the coating should not be thick.  This is important in order to\n      allow the light acting through the whole thickness of the\n      preparation when the paper is insolated under the cliché, for, if\n      the film be too opaque or too thick (by addition of too much gum\n      arabic), it would be only impressed on its surface, and the image\n      dissolved during the development.  The cause of this failure must be\n      explained.  Under the action of light the bichromate employed to\n      sensitize the albumen is reduced into chromic oxide which render\n      insoluble this organic substance—or any other, such as caseine,\n      gelatine, gum arabic, etc.; therefore whenever the film is not acted\n      on in its whole thickness, the subjacent part being still soluble,\n      is necessary washed off and with it the superficial impressed part,\n      that is, the image.\n\n  2d. Take 10 parts of lamp black and work it up in a mortar to the\n      consistency of a thin paste by gradually pouring a little of a\n      solution of from 6 to 8 parts of gum arabic and 1 part of liquid\n      glucose in 100 parts of water, adding afterwards the remainder, into\n      which 2½ parts of ammonium bichromate have been dissolved, and\n      filter through flannel.  With this, coat the paper by brushing so as\n      to form a thin and uniform film, and pin it up to dry in the dark.\n\nThese solutions keep well for a certain period.  We have kept the albumen,\nwhich we prefer to use, for two months in good condition; but the\nsensitive paper does not for more than three or four days in taking the\nusual care.  It is more practical—and this is recommended—to leave out the\nbichromate from the preparations, and to coat the paper, in quantity,\nbeforehand, and for use to sensitize it with a solution of potassium\nbichromate at 3½ per cent. of water applied on the verso with a Buckle\nbrush.(25)\n\nThe bichromate solution should be allowed to imbue the paper for about one\nminute, and having brushed it once more, the paper is pinned up to dry in\nthe dark room.  It can also be sensitized from the back by floating, if\nthis manner is found more convenient.\n\nWhen dry the paper is impressed under a negative cliché of good intensity\nuntil the design, well defined in all its details, is visible on the back\nof the paper, which requires an insolation of about two minutes in clear\nsunshine, and from eight to ten times longer in the shade.  In cloudy\nweather the exposure to light is necessarily very long.\n\nAs explained before, the luminous action, by reducing the chromic salt in\npresence of certain organic substances, causes the latter to become\ninsoluble; consequently if, on its removal from the printing frame, the\nproof be soaked in cold water, for, say, ten minutes, and, placing it on a\nglass plate or a smooth board, gently rubbed with a brush or a soft rag,\nthe parts of the albumen or gum arabic preparation not acted on will\ndissolve, leaving behind the black image standing out on the white ground\nof the paper.  This done, and when the unreduced bichromate is washed out\nin two changes of water, the operation is at an end.\n\nAs to the theory of this and similar processes, the insolubilization of\nthe bichromate organic substance acted on by light was formerly attributed\nto the oxidation of the substance by the oxygen evolved during the\nreduction of the chromic salt into chromic oxide; but from the fact that\noxidation generally tends to destroy organic matters, or to increase their\nsolubility, it is more probable that it results from the formation of a\npeculiar compound of the substance with chromic oxide (J. W. Swan);\nmoreover, gelatine imbued with an alkaline bichromate, then immersed first\nin a solution of ferrous sulphate and afterwards in hot water, is\ninsolubilized with formation of chromium trioxide, Cr2O7K2+SO4Fe =\nSO4K2+C2O4Fe+C2O3 (Monckhoven).  A similar but inverse action occurs, as\nshown by Poitevin, when gelatine rendered insoluble by ferric chloride\nbecomes soluble by the transformation, under the influence of light, of\nthe ferric salt into one at the minimum.\n\nThe writer has improved the above process by simplifying the modus\noperandi as follows:\n\nInstead of compounding the preparation with gum arabic and the coloring\nmatter, the albumen is simply clarified by beating the whites of eggs to a\nfroth, etc., and the paper is coated by floating for one minute, then hung\nup to dry in a place free from dust.\n\nIf the reader has any objection for albumenizing his own paper, he can use\nthe albumen paper found in the market for the printing-out silver process\ngenerally employed by photographers.\n\nThe paper is sensitized from the back with the potassium bichromate bath\nby floating or by brushing.  When dry, it is exposed as usual, but for a\nshorter period than when the preparation contains the India ink or other\ncoloring matters which impede the action of light.\n\nThe progress of the impression is followed by viewing, from time to time,\nthe albumenized side of the paper.  When the design is visible, well\ndefined and brownish, the proof, being removed from the printing frame, is\nrubbed with very finely powdered, or, better, levigated graphite, and,\nthis done, immersed in cold water for from fifteen to twenty minutes, when\nby gently rubbing it under a jet of water with a soft rag, or with a\nsponge imbued with water, the albumen is washed off from the parts not\nacted on, leaving the design on a perfectly white ground.\n\nIf instead of graphite, or any dry color insoluble in water, lithographic\nink, much thinned with turpentine oil, be applied on the print in a light\ncoating which permits one to see the design under it, and if, then, the\nprint be soaked in water and afterwards developed as just directed, an\nimage in greasy ink is obtained.  And, furthermore, by replacing the\nprinting by transfer ink, one readily obtains a transfer ready for the\nstone or a zinc plate to be etched in the ordinary manner.\n\nAs usual there are two causes of failures in these processes, viz., under\nand over-exposures.  In the former case the image is partly washed off; in\nthe latter the ground cannot be cleared.  The reasons are obvious.\n\nMr. de Saint Florent gives the following processes:(26) A sheet of\nalbumenized or gelatinized paper is sensitized from the verso on a\nsolution of potassium bichromate, dried in the dark and exposed under a\npositive cliché.  After insolation, the proof is washed in water, to which\nare added few drops of ammonia, then inked all over with an ink consisting\nof 100 parts of liquid India ink, 7 parts of sulphuric acid and 3 parts of\ncaustic potassa, and dried in a horizontal position.  When quite dry, the\nproof is placed in water, and after an immersion of about ten minutes,\nrubbed with a soft brush: the image little by little appears, and if the\ntime of exposure be right, it is soon entirely cleared, and, then, if not\nenough vigorous, it may be inked again.  The gloss of the image is removed\nby means of a solution of caustic potassa at 10 per 100, and the proof\nfinally washed with care.\n\nIf in lieu of albumen paper, one employs paper prepared with a  thin\ncoating of gelatine, and dissolves the not acted on gelatine in warm\nwater, a very fine positive image is obtained by means of acidified inks\nwhich will fix themselves on the bare paper.\n\nPositive impressions from positive clichés can also be obtained in\noperating in the following manner: On its removal from the printing frame\nthe proof is washed, sponged between sheets of blotting paper, then\ncovered with not acidified India ink mixed with potassium bichromate, and,\nwhen dry, exposed from the verso to the action of light.  This done the\nimage is cleared with a somewhat hard brush.\n\n\n\n\nTHE CARBON PROCESS.\n\n\nThe carbon tissue is seldom prepared by photographers. However, for the\nsake of completeness, we shall give the formula of the mixtures most\ngenerally employed, and describe the manner of coating the paper on a\nsmall scale.\n\n_Preparation of the Tissue.—_The gelatine generally recommended to\ncompound the mixture is the Nelson’s autotype gelatine.  Coignet’s gold\nlabel gelatine, mixed with a more soluble product, such as Cox’s gelatine,\nfor example, gives also excellent results.\n\nGelatine    110 parts\nSugar       25 parts\nSoap, dry   12 parts\nWater       350 parts\n\nThe coloring substances consist of:\n\n FOR ENGRAVING BLACK.\nLamp-black     20 parts\nCrimson lake   2 parts\nIndigo         1 part\n\n   FOR WARM BLACK.\nLamp-black     3 parts\nCrimson lake   3 parts\nBurnt amber    2 parts\nIndigo         1 part\n\n         FOR SEPIA\nLamp-black         2 parts\nSepia of Cologne   18 parts\n\n FOR PHOTOGRAPHIC RED BROWN.\nIndia ink        3 parts\nCrimson lake     4 parts\nVan Dyck brown   4 parts\n\nFor blue, Turnbull’s blue is employed; for yellow, light chrome yellow;\nfor red, carmine dissolved in aqueous ammonia, evaporating, then adding\nwater, etc. (See further on.)\n\nTo prepare the mixture, dissolve the sugar and soap in the cold water, add\nthe gelatine, let it soak for an hour, then dissolve it in a water bath\nand mix by small quantity the colors finely ground together and wetted to\nthe consistency of a paste.  After filtering through flannel the mixture\nis ready for use.\n\nFor coating, the method devised by Mr. Alf. Harman has been found\nexcellent in the hands of the writer, not only for the purpose in\nquestion, but also for coating paper with gelatinous or viscous (gum\narabic) preparations.\n\n“Take two tin dishes, such as used for the development of the carbon\nprints; arrange one on your bench tilted to an angle; the lower angle is\nintended to receive the warm water for keeping the gelatine mixture to a\nproper temperature.  Into this angle of the tray arrange another tray\nsomewhat smaller, and keep it from touching the bottom of the outer one by\nthe insertion of any small article that will suggest itself. Into the\ninner tray the gelatine mixture is to be poured.”\n\n“The actual making of the tissue can now be proceeded with, and is so\nsimple and certain as not to be believed until put to the test.  Purchase\na roll of paper-hanger’s lining paper of good quality, cut it into widths\nof about one and a half inch less than the width of your inner tray, and\nin length of, say, thirty inches.  For the success of the operation it is\nnecessary that the paper be rolled up the narrow way.  Now having just\nsufficient water at a temperature of 100 deg. Fahr. (38 deg. C.) into the\nouter tray, pour the gelatine mixture into the inner one, and take one of\nthe lengths of rolled paper, and, holding it by both ends, gently lower it\non the surface of the gelatine; then at once slowly raise the end of the\npaper, which will unroll itself and become beautifully coated in far less\ntime than it takes to describe.  Twenty sheets may be coated in a quarter\nof an hour, and be equal in all respects to that made by the most\nexpensive machine.”\n\nIn the description of this method of coating, Mr. Harman does not explain\nhow the gelatine should be allowed to set before hanging up the paper to\ndry, which is, however, obviously important.  It is as follows: Place on\nthe tray a smooth board a little larger than the sheet of paper, leaving a\nsmall space at the end furthest from the body, and slowly, without a stop,\ndraw off the paper, prepared side uppermost, on the board upon which it\nshould remain until the gelatine is set.  If the paper curls up, wet the\nback a little with a sponge before coating.\n\nThe following coating method, due to Mr. Chardon, is excellent for sheets\nof paper of the ordinary photographic size, 18×22 inches.\n\nOn a glass plate placed on a leveled stand, is laid a sheet of paper\npreviously wetted, which is then flattened into contact with an India\nrubber squeegee, taking care to remove the air bubbles interposed. The\nquantity of gelatine necessary to coat the paper is regulated by means of\na glass rod held by an iron lath, which serves to handle it; at each end\nof the rod is inserted a piece of an India rubber tube whose thickness\nregulates that of the gelatine layer. The mixture is poured from a small\nteapot, at the opening of which has been adapted a bent glass tube about\nthree-sixteenths of an inch in diameter, between the rod and the lath, so\nthat by a simultaneous motion, one can equalize the gelatine as it is\npoured on. When the gelatine is set the paper is hung up to dry.  In\ndrying, the gelatine contracts, and, necessarily, causes a deformation of\nthe tissue, which curls up at the edges and loses its planimetry.  To\nprevent this, while the gelatine is almost dry, the tissue is placed under\npressure until quite desiccated.  Dumoulin advises to apply on the film,\nwhile still soft and tacky, a wooden frame, which, by adhering to it.\nkeeps the tissue perfectly plane as it dries.\n\n                      [Chardon’s method of coating]\n\n_Sensitizing.—_The tissue is sensitized in a bath of potassium bichromate.\nThe degree of concentration of the bath, which varies from 2 to 5 per\ncent. of water, is important.  The tissue sensitized in a weak bath is\nless rapidly acted on by light and yields more contrasts than when imbued\nin a concentrated one.  The former should consequently be employed for\nprinting weak negatives, and the latter for those which are intense.  A\nbath compounded with 30 parts of potassium bichromate, 1,000 parts of\nwater and 2 parts of aqueous ammonia, is used for printing negatives of\nthe ordinary intensity, the tissue being, then practically of the same\nsensitiveness, a silvered paper insolated to obtain a print not\nover-exposed.  For intense negatives the ammonia should be discarded and\nreplaced by the same quantity of chromic acid.\n\nThe time of immersion has also a certain influence on the results.  The\nless the tissue is allowed to absorb the solution the less sensitive it\nis, but also the more the tendency of the half tints to be washed off\nduring the development.  Generally the tissue should remain immersed until\nit lies flat and the edges just commence to curl up, unless white and\nblack impressions are desired, but even then it is preferable to operate\nas said above, using a bath at 2 per cent.\n\nFor use the bichromate bath should be cooled down to 15 deg. C. (59 deg.\nFahr.), and much lower in summer, say 10 deg. C. (50 deg. Fahr.), and kept\nat about this temperature by placing pieces of ice around the tray.  At 20\ndeg. C. (68 deg. Fahr.) the prints are more or less granulated; above this\nthe gelatine is softened and the reticulation greater; at 25 deg. C. (75\ndeg. Fahr.) it may dissolve.\n\nThe addition of alcohol to the bichromate bath—sometimes recommended to\nharden the film and allow it to stand a higher temperature, and to hasten\nthe desiccation of the tissue—is objectionable, for the spirits tend to\nreduce the bichromate, which is transformed into the green salt, and,\ntherefore, a partial or complete insolubilization of the gelatine is the\nresult.\n\nAqueous ammonia added to the sensitizing solution has for its object to\npermit one to keep the sensitive tissue for a somewhat longer period, but\nit renders it less sensitive.  If enough be added to turn the solution\nyellow weak prints are obtained.\n\nThe bichromate bath should be renewed often. It does not keep owing to the\npresence of gelatine and other organic matters which it dissolves and\nwhich cause the reduction of the chromic salt even in the dark.  The\ntissue prepared in such a bath is not very sensitive and the image\ndevelops with difficulty, and even cannot be developed at all.\n\nAs said above, the tissue is well sensitized when its edges commence to\ncurl up.  It is then removed from the bath by drawing it on a glass rod\nfixed at the end of the tray, and placed, prepared side down, on a\nslightly waxed glass plate, rubbing it with an India rubber squeegee to\nremove the superflous liquid, when it is hung up to dry.\n\nWhile wet the bichromated tissue is insensitive; the sensitizing can\ntherefore be made by daylight, but the drying should of course be done in\nthe dark room, that is in a room lighted by a candle or the sunlight\nfiltered through a deep orange window glass.\n\n_Caution.—_The soluble bichromates are very poisonous.  By absorption they\nproduce skin diseases not without danger and very difficult to cure. Hence\nwhen handling the wet tissue the fingers should be protected by India\nrubber tips, and any yellow, stains on the hands should be rubbed with a\ndilute solution of aqueous ammonia, and the hands well rinsed in water.\n\n_Drying.—_When the tissue dries rapidly it adheres well on the support\nupon which it is applied for developing and yields brilliant images which\nare easily cleared.  On the other hand, were it allowed to dry slowly the\nadherence would not be so complete, the image dull and developing with\ndifficulty.  They may even refuse to develop at all from the\ninsolubilization of the gelatine.\n\nIn winter and in the cool days of spring and autumn, the gelatine dries\nquick enough in the air, but when the weather is warm and damp, the\ngelatine, drying very slowly, may be so softened as to run off, or to\nproduce an entirely objectionable reticulation, or the defects above\nmentioned.  This may be avoided by drying it pinned up in a box, or a\ncloset, over quick-lime.\n\nWhen dry, the tissue is generally wrinkled, brittle, breaks easily in\nhandling and cannot be laid flat on the cliché; but by holding it over a\nbasin of boiling water, the steam in a few moments rendering it\nsufficiently pliable to lay it flat between glass plates, where it should\nbe kept under pressure until wanted for use.\n\nThe writer always dries the tissue in the following manner, which he\ndevised about sixteen years ago.(27) And not only the least trace of\nreticulation is avoided, but the tissue, drying quite flat, lies in\nperfect contact with the negative, which is quite important to obtain\nproofs exactly sharp all over.\n\nA clean glass plate is rubbed with talc, or, which the writer prefers,\nflowed with a solution of(28)\nYellow wax, pure   1 part\nBenzine, pure      100 parts\n\nthen strongly heated, allowed to cool and rubbed clean (apparently) with a\npiece of flannel.  After once more repeating this operation the plate is\ncoated with the following plain collodion:(29)\n\nEther, conc.      250 parts, in volume\nAlcohol, 95 deg   250 parts, in volume\nPyroxyline        3 parts\n\nWhen the film is set, the plate is immersed in filtered water until\ngreasiness has disappeared, when on its removal from the bichromate bath\nthe tissue is laid, without draining, upon it and pressed into contact\nwith the squeegee to remove the excess of liquid and, with it, the air\nbubbles interposited.  The tissue is then allowed to dry in the air on the\ncollodionized plate in the cold season, or, when the weather is warm and\ndamp, in a box in the bottom of which is placed a quantity of quicklime in\nearthen dishes.  When dry, the plates are placed one upon another, wrapped\nin paper and kept in a dry place.  When wanted for use the tissue is\nstripped off and will be found quite flat with a beautiful surface to\nprint upon.\n\nOne should avoid to keep the sensitized tissue in a moist and warm\natmosphere, for in less than ten hours it becomes insoluble even in\ncomplete darkness.  It should neither be kept in the air contaminated with\ngaseous reductive matters, such as the products of the combustion of coal\ngas and petroleum, sulphydric or sulphurous emanations from any source,\nthe fumes of turpentine oil, etc., which, by reducing the chromic salt,\ncause the insolubilization of gelatine, prevent the print to adhere on the\nsupport or the clearing of the image, which may even refuse to develop.\n\nThe sensitive tissue keeps well for three or four weeks in cool and dry\nweather, and no more than eight or ten days in summer unless well\ndesiccated and kept in a preservative box.  If kept too long the image\ncannot be developed.\n\n_The Photometer.—_The time of exposure is regulated by means of a\nphotometer.  Of all the photometers which have been devised for that\npurpose we do not know any one more practical than that suggested in 1876\nby Mr. J. Loeffler, of Staten Island. It is made as follows: On a strip of\na thin glass plate, 6×2 inches, make four or five negatives, 1½×1¼ inch,\nexposing each one exactly for the same period and developing in the usual\nmanner, but without any intensification whatever.  It is even advisable to\nreduce the intensity if they were opaque.  Fix, etc., and apply a good\nhard varnish.  Now cover the back of these negatives with strips of\nvegetable paper or transparent celluloid, or, better, of thin sheets of\nmica, in such a manner as there be one thickness on the second negative,\ntwo on the third, three on the fourth, etc., leaving the first one\nuncovered.   Then place on the whole a glass plate of the same size as the\nfirst and border like a passe-partout.\n\n_The Negatives.—_For the carbon process the negatives should be intenser\nthan those intended for printing out on silver paper.  However, good\nproofs may be obtained from any negatives, so to say, by varying the\nstrength of the bichromate solution, as, also, by _using the tissue\nfreshly sensitized for weak negatives,_ in order to obtain vigor, and _for\nstrong negatives, the tissue two or three days after its preparation,_\nwhen it yields better half tones.  Printing dodges are also resorted to.\nThat the most commonly employed consists to varnish the back of the\nnegatives with a matt varnish, or to stretch on the same a sheet of\nmineral paper upon which the retouches are made by rubbing graphite,\nchrome yellow, pink or blue colors to strengthen the shadows or the\nwhites, as the case requires.  As a rule, it is advantageous to cover the\nprinting frame with tissue paper, whatever be the quality of the\nnegatives.\n\nThe negatives should be bordered with deep yellow or orange-red paper to\nform what is termed a “safe edge” upon which should rest the tissue in\norder to prevent the margin from being insolubilized by the reductive\naction of light.  If this precaution were neglected it would be impossible\nto strip off the paper without tearing the proof when the tissue is\napplied on the support upon which the image is to be developed.\n\nBefore exposing it is advisable to ascertain what the printing qualities\nof the negative are by making on silvered paper a proof of it—_not\nover-printed—_and another of the photometer, both being exposed at the\nsame time and for the same period.  This done, compare the proof from the\nnegative cliché with those of the photometer, and mark the negative with\nthe number of that of the photometer to which it corresponds, stating the\nshade of the proof next to it; for example: _No. 2_; _No. 3 faint, or\ncommences to appear,_ etc.  This No. 2 and the observation will indicate\nthe intensity of the negative and serve as a guide for printing on the\ntissue, since, as before explained, the silver paper is practically of the\nsame sensitiveness as the tissue prepared for negatives of the ordinary\nintensity.\n\n_Exposure.—_To print, the tissue is laid over the negative, taking care\nthat it covers the safe edge, and a strip of silvered paper placed in the\nphotometer, then both the printing frame and the photometer are exposed to\nlight side by side.\n\nUnless the negative be weak, when more vigor is obtained by exposing in\nsunshine, the printing should be done in the shade.  It is a well-known\nfact that the part of the bichromated film corresponding to the half\ntones in the lights are not sufficiently impressed in comparison to the\nblacks while impressed in direct sun’s light in this as well as in the\ncollotype, photogravure and other processes with the chromic salts,\nbecause the luminous action through the bare glass, or nearly so, which in\nthe negative represent the shadows and half blacks, is more energetic in\nproportion than through the other parts, from which it results that these\nparts being most acted on are made deeply insoluble through the thickness\nof the film, and then require to be cleared by a treatment with water at a\nhigher temperature than the parts representing the half tints in the\nlights of the picture, which are but superficially and slightly insoluble,\ncan stand.\n\nFrom time to time during the exposure the print in the photometer is\nexamined, and when a certain picture is printed to a certain shade, or\nwhen the one next by commences to appear or is faintly printed, etc., the\nexposure of the tissue is sufficient.  This, as the reader has already\ninferred, is a matter of experience, the guide being the knowledge of the\nintensity negative tested as above explained.\n\n_Development.—_The carbon prints are developed either on a sheet of paper\nupon which it should remain (single or simple transfer), or on a provisory\nsupport to be afterwards transferred on paper or any other material\n(double transfer).\n\n_Simple Transfer.—_This process is quite simple: The impressed tissue and\na sheet of paper coated with alumed (insoluble) gelatine are immersed face\nto face in cold water, and when the tissue is softened both are removed,\none superposed on the other, and the whole, being placed on a glass plate\nand covered with a thin oil cloth, is firmly pressed into contact with the\nsqueegee.  The rationale of applying under water the tissue on the\ngelatinized paper is to avoid the interposition of air bubbles.\n\nTo operate by simple transfer the tissue should be impressed under a\nreversed negative.  The reason is obvious.\n\n_Double Transfer.—_By this method the carbon prints are generally\ndeveloped on porcelain or opal plates, which more easily than glass plates\npermit one to follow the progress of the development and to retouch the\nimperfections before transferring the picture on paper.\n\nIn order that the image does not adhere on the provisory support a little\nof the following mixture is spread over the plate, which is then pretty\nstrongly heated, and, when it has cooled down, polished lightly with a\npiece of white flannel to obtain a very thin and even layer free from\nstriæ.  If the plate has not been used before for the purpose in question,\nit should be waxed a second time in the same manner:\n\nYellow wax              4 parts\nRosin                   1 part\nTurpentine or benzine   250 parts\n\nThe plates can be developed on the plates so waxed, but for “full gloss,”\nthat is, for enameled pictures, a film of collodion is applied on the\nplates, which then, instead of being waxed, should to be simply flowed\nwith a solution of India rubber 1 to 100 of benzole:\n\nEther        250 parts\nAlcohol      250 parts\nCastor oil   1 part\nPyroxyline   5 to 6 parts\n\nWhen the plate is coated and the collodion film set, it is immersed in\nwater until greasiness has disappeared and wanted for use.  Then the\ntissue, previously soaked in water, is applied upon it (taking care to\navoid air bubbles) and squeezed, lightly at first, with some force\nafterwards, to insure a perfect contact.\n\nZinc plates are also employed as provisory supports instead of glass, opal\nor porcelain plates.   The modus operandi is exactly the same.(30) The\nplates should be well planed, free from scratches, etc., and well polished\nto obtain glossy pictures without one having recourse to a film of\ncollodion.  For matt pictures, i.e., without gloss whatever, the plate\nshould be finely granulated, and when waxing a very light pressure should\nbe exerted to remove the excess of wax, else it might be quite impossible\nto strip off the picture in transferring on paper.\n\nFor double transfer on biscuits, objects in alabaster, porcelain, wood,\nany even or curved rigid materials, flexible supports are employed to\ndevelop the pictures.  These supports are prepared by fastening albumen\npaper on a board and evenly brushing over the following hot compound,\nfiltered through flannel, which, when dry, is polished with a cloth:\nStearine   15 parts\nRosin      3 parts\nAlcohol    100 parts\n\nThe flexible supports should be waxed, then collodionized for full gloss,\nas the glass, porcelain and metallic plates.\n\nAnother method which the writer recommends is the following, due to Mr.\nSwan: Immerse a sheet of paper in a solution of India rubber, 4:100 of\nbenzole, and let dry, which requires a few minutes.  This is the flexible\nsupport.  Then after exposure, brush over the India rubber solution on the\ncarbon tissue, apply upon it the support when the benzole is evaporated,\nand pass the whole under a rolling press to secure adhesion, then develop.\nTo transfer, soak the proof in tepid water, apply it on the material\nprepared, as it will be explained further on, and when dry, imbue the\nsupport from the back with benzole, to soften the India rubber, and strip.\n\nTo dispense with a rolling press, the proof may be developed on lacquered\nvegetable paper prepared by immersion in a solution of 10 parts of red\nshellac in 100 parts of alcohol.  After developing the proof is coated\nwith alumed gelatine, and when dry transferred as usual. To strip off it\nsuffices to imbue the paper with alcohol in order to dissolve the shellac.\n\nWhen the picture must be transferred on small spaces or on small objects\nthe most simple method—the most effective, perhaps—is the following,\ndevised some years ago by the writer and now employed for the ornaments of\n“articles de Paris:” Prepare the provisory support as usual, but with a\nthicker film of collodion; then, after developing and coloring, if\nnecessary, the picture is coated with gelatine, to which may be added some\nzinc white or other colored substance to form a ground.  This dry, strip\noff, immerse the pellicle in water to soften the gelatine and transfer on\nthe material collodion side up.\n\nThe proofs should be developed within three or four hours after\ninsolation, for the luminons action continues pretty actively in the dark,\nand this for a long time; thus: a proof rightly exposed in the morning\nbehaves as one over-exposed if developed in the evening, and after a\ncertain period either can not be developed or refuses to adhere on the\nsupport.  However, the proofs can be kept for three weeks, may be more,\nbefore development, if the soluble bichromate be washed off, the tissue\nsponged and dried rapidly in the warm season.  This capital improvement is\ndue to Mr. Charles Brasseur.\n\nIt has been said that before being applied on the support the proof should\nbe immersed in water to soften the tissue.  The time which it should be\nallowed to absorb water has an importance which must not be neglected.  If\nit do not remain long enough to be soaked through, small invisible air\nbubbles are formed on its surface, and interposing themselves between the\nimage and the support, form minute, brilliant, silver-like spots on the\nfinished picture; and, if the temperature of the water is above 20 deg. C.\n(68 deg. Fahr.), the image will be more or less reticulated.  The\ntemperature depends a good deal of the softness of the gelatine; 15 deg.\nC. (59 deg. Fahr.) is safe, except, however, when the thermometer is in\nthe thirtieths (90th Fahr.), when the water should be cooled down a few\ndegrees lower, but not at the melting ice temperature, for then the proof\nwould not adhere well.  As a rule, the tissue should remain in the cold\nwater until it becomes flat and shows a tendency to curl up.  It is at\nthis very moment that it should be squeezed on the support.\n\nThe proofs should not be developed immediately after transferring.  The\nadherence is greater and the pictures finer and devoid of defects when the\ndevelopment is made half an hour, and even an hour, after.  If developed\ntoo soon the picture will be partly, and even entirely, washed off.\nHence, a number of transfers can be prepared beforehand, placing them,\nface to face one upon another, in order that the tissue does not dry,\nwhich is quite essential.\n\nTo develop, the plate, with the tissue adhering to it, is placed in water\nheated to 30 deg. C. (80 deg. Fahr.), where it is left rocking the tray\noccasionally until the paper rises up by itself at the corners, when\ntaking hold of it by one corner, it is stripped off, leaving behind the\nimage buried in soluble gelatine.  Should the paper offer any resistance\nwhatever, the gelatine should be allowed to become more soluble by\nincreasing the temperature of the water, or by a longer immersion.  There\nis, in fact, no objection to this.  The plate—and that is a good\nmethod—can be placed in an upright position in a tin box, made ad hoc, and\nleft therein in warm water until the paper detaches itself and the image\nis partly developed _and the bichromate washed off._  This done, the plate\nis held in an inclined position on a tray filled with water at 35 deg. C.\n(95 deg. Fahr.), which is dashed with a wooden spoon on the image to clear\nit from the non-acted-on gelatine.  Presently one can judge whether the\nexposure is right.  If it is too short, the half tints in the shadows are\nwashed off, unless the negative be too intense, when a similar effect also\noccurs in the whites.  If it is too long, either the image is with\ndifficulty cleared or remains undeveloped.  In the latter case, it is\nrecommended by some operators to increase the temperature of the\ndeveloping water to near the boiling point, and, for local clearing, to\npour it on.  This we find objectionable, for the half tints are easily\nwashed off.  A better process, when the picture can not be cleared by\nwater at 50 deg. (122 deg. Fahr.), or thereabout, is to use a solution of\ncommon salt at 5 or 6 per cent. of slightly warm water.(31) It is even\npreferable to finish the development in a tepid solution of potassium\nsulpho-cyanide, 12:100.  The dissolving action is long, but not only, as\nsaid above, the half tints are best preserved, but blistering  and local\nwashing-off are avoided.\n\nAfter development the plate is rinsed under the tap, then flowed two or\nthree times with a solution of chrome alum at 1 per cent. of water, then\nwashed, and finally allowed to dry spontaneously.\n\nIt is objectionable to use a strong solution of alum, and in it to immerse\nthe plate for any length of time; the gelatine is considerably\nhardened—which is not necessary—and more liable to crack by time in being\nthoroughly desiccated.  We discard the common alum which we found liable\nto produce a slight reticulation.\n\nTwo defects are complained of by the beginners, viz., the want of\nadherence of the deep blacks, and, especially, the isolated and fine lines\nwhen the picture is a reproduction of an engraving, a drawing, etc., and\nthe liability in half tone pictures of the delicate details being washed\nout.  The first defects are avoided by pouring a solution of boric acid on\nthe transitory support before applying the tissue and developing at a low\ntemperature with salted water.  The second from an imperfect knowledge of\nthe properties of gelatine acted on by light in presence of a salt of\nchromic acid.  One should bear in mind that the degree of solubility of\ngelatine so acted on, as also its degree of impermeability—which is\nimportant in certain processes of photogravure—is proportionate to the\ndegree of insolation; thus, when not impressed, bichromated gelatine\ndissolves in water heated to about from 25 to 30 deg. C. (77 to 80 deg.\nFahr.), and when acted on between 30 and 100 deg. C. (86 to 112 deg.\nFahr.), according as to the degree of insolation, that is, of reduction of\nthe chromic salt, the latter temperature being that of insolubility of the\nparts the most acted on.  The very delicate half tints do not, generally,\nstand a temperature higher than 35 deg. C. (95 deg. Fahr.), and,\ntherefore, as the degree of insolubility of the various parts cannot be\nascertained, a priori, it is advisable during the development to increase\ngradually the temperature of the water from this degree, and not to exceed\n45 deg. C. (113 deg. Fahr.), in order to obtain the most perfect result\nfrom a negative of good intensity.  Indeed, by placing the supports on a\nrack and immersing the whole in water heated to 30 to 35 deg. C. (86 to 95\ndeg. Fahr.), the image will clear up by itself to perfection in a certain\nperiod.  This method is excellent for proofs in lines.  Those from the\ngrained negatives employed in photogravure are still more perfectly\ndeveloped in a tepid solution of potassium sulphocyanate, since the\nimpressions wholly consist of insoluble parts (the lines) and gelatine not\nacted on.\n\n_Retouching.—_The retouches are easily made. They should be done before\ntransferring when working by the double transfer process.\n\nThe transparent spots, and any parts which should be altered, are\nretouched with the material of the tissue dissolved in warm water; the\nwhites are cleared with a scraper; and any parts which are not intense\nenough, or which should be blended by the addition of half tints, are\nworked on the proof—to which a tooth has been given by rubbing with\ncuttle-fish powder—by means of a stump and an appropriate color, a mixture\nof lamp-black and carmine, for example, in very fine powder.\n\nThe proofs can also be colored by chemical means (see further on), or with\nwater colors employed with a solution of chrome alum, 1 to 200 of water,\nor gilt, silvered or bronzed with metallic powders applied with the\ngilder’s size thinned with turpentine on the proof previously coated with\na thin layer of alumed gelatine.\n\n_Second Transfer.—_To transfer, a sheet of enameled or simple transfer\npaper is immersed in tepid water until the gelatine is softened and feels\nslippery to the fingers.  The support is then placed under water at\nordinary temperatures—not under 16 deg. C. (60 deg. F.)—for two three\nminutes, then rubbed with a camel brush to remove the air bubbles, which\nmight be formed on the surface of the image, when, without draining, the\ngelatinized paper is laid upon it, covered with the thin oil cloth, and\npressed into contact with the squeegee, commencing in the center to the\nsweep off the water, then repeating the operation for the other half, as\nexplained to apply the tissue on the provisory support.  When the whole is\nquite dry, which requires three or four hours, the edges are cut with a\npenknife and the whole stripped off.  It may happen that the proof is\ncovered with minute, silver-like brilliant spots, which are nothing else\nthan very small air bubbles interposited between the carbon proof and the\ntransfer paper. They are caused by the gelatine paper not having been\nsufficiently softened or not laid on the proof with proper care. The\ndefect may also arise from the transfer paper coated with not sufficiently\nthick gelatine.\n\nTo transfer on any rigid material, the proofs on flexible supports are\ncoated by floating on the following gelatine solution, then allowed to\ndry, and, when wanted for use, immersed in tepid water to soften the\ngelatine and secure adherence:\n\nGelatine                   50 parts\nWater                      400 parts\nSolution of chrome alum,   6 parts\n4:100\n\n_Development on Absorbing Materials.—_The development of carbon prints on\nabsorbent material—such as canvas and palettes to be painted in oil,\netc.—cannot be made in the ordinary manner on account of the impossibility\nto eliminate entirely the chromic salt which tinges the material yellow.\nTo turn the difficulty, it suffices to wash off in several changes of cold\nwater all the unaltered bichromate from the prints on their removal from\nthe printing frame, and to proceed as usual, or the prints can be allowed\nto dry and transferred at some future time.\n\nCanvas should be prepared by brushing with a solution of aqueous ammonia\nin alcohol, 5:20, to remove greasiness until the thread is apparent, and,\nwhen dry, rubbed with sand to grain it—or to give a tooth, as it is\ntermed—then rubbed dry with a solution of soluble glass, 1 to 10 of\nbeer.(32)\n\nPalettes should be rendered impervious, or nearly so, by flowing upon them\na solution of alumed gelatine, which is allowed to penetrate into the\npores of the wood and the excess scraped off when solidified, when the\nsurface may be whitened, if necessary, as for printing on wood box, q.v.\n\nOpals, porcelain, or ivory should be prepared with the following\nsubstratum:\n\nGelatine             50 parts\nWater                400 parts\nChrome alum, 4:100   6 parts\n\nVery fine carbon proofs having the appearance of pictures on opal plates\nare made by transferring in the following manner, devised by the author:\n\nDevelop on the ground surface of a glass or porcelain plate, well waxed,\nto obtain a matt picture, or in the ordinary manner for "full gloss," and\nwhen the image is retouched or colored, apply a thin coating of gelatine,\nlet dry and coat with the following opaque collodion:\n\nA.   Ether, conc.         100 parts\n     Alcohol, 95 deg      90 parts\n     Pyroxyline           7 parts\nB.   White zinc in very   9 parts\n     fine powder\n     Castor oil           3 parts\n     Alcohol              10 parts\n\nGrind in a mortar, adding ultramarine blue and carmine, or a little of any\nsuitable coloring matters, and mix to A. When the collodion is dry, which\nrequires a few hours, strip the whole or back with strong white or colored\npaper before stripping. A solution of gelatine with glycerine, white zinc,\netc., may be substituted for collodion when the pictures are employed as\nornaments on wood, etc. Carbon prints on celluloid are now made for\nsimilar purposes.\nOPAL GELATINE SOLUTION\nGelatine      150 parts\nGlycerine     15 parts\nZinc, white   40 parts\nWater         600 parts\n\nTo which some coloring matters may be added according to taste.  Grind the\nwhite with the glycerine and a little water, mix to the gelatine dissolved\nin the remainder of water, and filter through canvas.  Apply the mixture\nmoderately hot, 30 deg. C. (86 deg. Fahr.)\n\n_Transparencies.—_The transparencies are printed on a special tissue sold\nunder the name of “diapositive.”  It differs from the ordinary tissue in\nthis, that the mixture contains a greater quantity of the color matter,\nIndia ink, which is ground exceedingly fine.\n\nThe proofs for transparencies should be printed deeper than those to be\nseen by reflection, and developed on thin glass plates, free from any\ndefects, and coated with either one of the following substrata:\n\nSoluble glass   5 parts\nWhite of eggs   15 parts\nWater           20 parts\n\nThe whole is beaten up to a thick froth and allowed to subside, when the\nclear liquid is decanted, filtered through flannel and the glass plates\ncoated.  The substratum should be allowed to dry for a few hours, and\nrinsed under the tap before use.\n\nThe other substratum consists of\n\nGelatine             35 parts\nAcetic acid, No. 8   250 parts\nAlcohol, 95 deg      50 parts\nWater                700 parts\nChrome alum, 4:100   60 parts\n\nDissolve the gelatine in the acid at a moderate heat, add afterwards the\nalcohol and water, and lastly mix the chrome alum by small quantities at a\ntime.\n\nThese substrata are employed to avoid the peeling off of the image.  To\nprevent the entire desiccation of the gelatine, which is the cause of the\ndefect above alluded to, it is advisable to add glycerine to the washing\nwater after the image is cleared.  Some operators recommend a coating of\nflexible collodion, that is, prepared with castor oil, for the purpose in\nquestion.  We do not think that necessary when the transparencies are not\nexposed to sunshine.  If anything should be applied we would prefer the\nencaustic.\n\nCarbon transparencies are invaluable for reproducing negatives in the\noriginal size by the same (carbon) process, or for enlarging by the\ncollodion or gelatine process.  For these purposes they should be made on\nthe special red tissue manufactured by the Autotype Company, of London,\nEng.  They can, however, be made on the ordinary tissues.\n\nWhatever be the tissue employed, the transparencies for the reproduction\nof negatives are seldom opaque enough, and should be intensified.  This is\ndone by treating them with a very dilute solution of sodium permanganate,\nwhich colors them olive green.\n\nTransparencies for lantern slides, etc., are best colored with the\ncouleurs à l’albumine of L. Encausse, sold by J. Reygondaud, Paris\n(France).  They are transparent.(33)\n\n_Toning and Intensifying.—_The carbon proofs can be toned and at the same\ntime intensified by reagents acting with chromic oxide.\n\nThe dyes or coloring matters precipitated are not opaque, and, as a\nconsequence, not objectionable for transparencies.  The following\nprocesses are the most employed:\n\nPrepare three solutions as follows:\n\nA.   Ferric sulphate    5 parts\n     Water              100 parts\nB.   Sodium carbonate   2 parts\n     Water              100 parts\nC.   Gallic acid        5 parts\n     Water              100 parts\n\nDissolve the gallic acid in warm water.  Filter each solution.  They keep\nwell.\n\nTo tone, the plate is immersed for, say, ten minutes in A, then, after\nrinsing slightly, it is placed in B for the same period, rinsed again and\nflowed with C until the desired color is obtained.  The tone is a splendid\npurple black color.  If a solution of pyrogallol be substituted to that of\ngallic acid, the tone is green, and to a green bordering to black when a\nsolution of catechu is used, the catechu exerting at the same time a\ntanning action on the gelatine.  After toning, the plate should be\nthoroughly washed.\n\nA similar process consists to wet the plate under the tap, then to flow\nover a mixture by about equal volumes of\n\nA.   Ferrous sulphate     5 parts\n     Acetic acid, No. 8   5 parts\n     Water                100 parts, filter\nB.   Gallic acid          5 parts\n     Water                100 parts\n\nWhen toned, the plate is well washed, then flowed once with the alum\nsolution and again washed.  The tone by this process easily turns to an\ninky blue not very agreeable.  The action should be stopped a little\nbefore the desired color is obtained.\n\nIt sometimes happens that the image in drying intensifies more then\nnecessary.  It can be cleared with a solution of oxalic or citric acid.\n\nA brown sepia is obtained by toning first with potassium permanganate, 1\nper cent. of water, then, after washing, with a solution of pyrogallol.\nIf gallic acid be used instead of pyrogallol, the tone is black.  By this\nprocess a great intensity is obtained.  A dilute solution of ammonium\nsulphide can be employed as a clearing agent.\n\nPyrogallol and silver nitrate give a warm black tone.\n\nPotassium bichromate followed by silver nitrate form a brick-red\nprecipitate of some opacity.(34)\n\nChloride of nickel and potassium ferrocyanate produce a fine brown.\n\nLime water and alizarine dissolved in alcohol dye violet.\n\nAlizarine and the caustic alkalies produce a variety of tints, from violet\nto purple, according to the concentration of the solutions.\n\nLead acetate and alizarine in ammoniacal solution dye purple.\n\nPotassium ferrocyanide and uranium nitrate produce a warm sepia tone. With\nchloride of nickel the tone is brown.\n\nAmmoniacal solution of coralline diluted with water gives carmine red.\n\nPotassium bichromate and extract of indigo produce a fine greenish tone\nsuitable for landscapes.\n\nExtract of indigo colors blue(35)\n\nSome of these reactions can be applied to the printing processes with the\nbichromates, etc.  The paper should be coated with galatine.  See the\nAppendix.\n\nOther colorations can be obtained with dyes in utilizing (as shown by\nPersoz) chromous chromic oxide as a mordant: alizarine, Brazil and yellow\nwood (morus tinctoria), Fustet (rhus cotinus), etc.  The extent of this\nwork does not admit of describing the numerous processes which can be\nemployed; they will suggest themselves to the chemist.\n\nThe alkalies employed with the dyes should be employed in diluted\nsolutions, as being liable to produce reticulation.  By applying the\ncoloring matters and the mordants thickened with a little starch, the\nimage can be colored with different colors.  Lantern slides can be thus\ncolored with great ease.\n\n\n\nPREPARATION OF RED, YELLOW, OR BLUE TISSUES.\n\n\n_Red Tissue.—_Dissolve 10 grams of carmine in 1 liter of aqueous ammonia\nand evaporate.  When the smell of the alkali has almost disappeared, add 1\nliter of rain water.  Of this take 65 cubic centimeters, add 35 c.c.m. of\nrain water, and in the solution let soak for an hour 15 grams of very\nsoluble gelatine, add 1 gram of sugar, and dissolve in a water bath.\nFilter, and take of the mixture a sufficient quantity (25 c.c.m. for a\nsurface 18×24 centimeters) to cover a sheet of paper which has been\npreviously applied upon a glass plate in the following manner: In a tray\nfull of hot water, immerse the plate and the paper; remove the whole in\nsuch a manner as the paper remains in contact with the plate; rub out the\nexcess of water with a squeegee, and flow the gelatine over the paper\nstill damp.  Let cool on a leveled stand, and when the gelatine is\nsolidified to a consistent jelly, remove the paper from the plate and\nplace it to dry in an oven heated at not over 24 or 25 deg. C.\n\nIt is desirable that in drying the paper does not curl up.  To that end,\napply over it, before it being removed from the plate a wooden frame to\nwhich the gelatine, still sticky, will sufficiently adhere to hold the\ntissue when it stretches in drying.\n\n_Yellow Tissue.—_Pulverize to an impalpable powder 25 grams of light\nchrome yellow in tablets (water color), and gradually add in stirring 1\nliter of rain water.  Take 100 c.c.m. of this and into it let soak for an\nhour 15 grams of the same gelatine used for the red tissue, add 1 gram of\nsugar, then proceed as above.\n\n_Blue Tissue.—_In a liquid consisting of 85 c.c.m. of rain water and from\n12 to 15 c.c.m. of blue ink, such as sold by stationers, let soak for an\nhour 15 grams of the same gelatine and 1 gram of sugar, and proceed.\n\n_Preparation of Transfer Paper.—_Two kinds of transfer paper are\nemployed—the enamel and plain transfer paper.\n\nTo enamel the paper: Dissolve 100 parts of barium nitrate in 500 parts of\nwater, and, on the other hand, 200 parts of sodium sulphate in the same\nquantity of water.  Mix, wash well the precipitate—barium sulphate—by\ndecantation, and when well drained, mix to the following solution:\n\nGelatine, Coignet’s   300  parts\nGlycerine             80  parts\nUltramarine blue      1  part\nCrimson lake          0.1 part\nWater                 2,500  parts\n\nLet soak the gelatine for, say, one hour, dissolve by heat, then add by\nsmall quantities, stirring violently, 4 parts of chrome alum dissolved in\n250 parts of hot water.  Filter through flannel and coat the paper as\ndirected to prepare the tissue.  The mixture should be employed\nimmediately after adding the chrome alum.\n\nThe plain transfer paper is prepared in the same manner, leaving out the\nbarium sulphate and the coloring matters.\n\n_Preparation of the Silver Paper.—_Immerse the paper for two minutes in a\nsolution of—\n\nSodium chloride (common   2 parts\nsalt, dry)\nLemon juice               1 part\nWater                     100 parts (filter)\n\nWhen dry and wanted for use, sensitize the salted paper by floating for\none minute on—\n\nSilver nitrate   8  parts\nNitric acid      0.1 part\nWater            100  parts\n\nOn its removal from the silver bath, sponge the paper between sheets of\nblotting paper and hang it up to dry.\n\nENCAUSTIC FOR SINGLE TRANSFER PROOFS.\nWhite wax           25 parts\nMastic              3 parts\nTurpentine          100 parts\n\nDissolve by heat, first the mastic, then the wax, and keep for use in a\nlarge mouthed vial.\n\n      MATT VARNISH.\nSandarac        6 parts\nMastic          6 parts\nLavender oil.   0.5 parts\nEther           100 parts\n\nWhen dissolved, add 30 parts of benzine.  The opacity of the film varies\nwith the quantity of benzine added; by excess the varnish dries\ntransparent.\n\n         WATER COLORS WHICH RESIST THE ACTION OF LIGHT.\nRed.      Indian red.    Light red.\nOrange.   Mars yellow.\nBlue.     Cobalt blue.   French blue.   Smalt.         New blue.\nBrown.    Raw umber.     Burnt\n                         sienna.\nGreen     Terre verte.\nYellow.   Cadmium        Yellow         Roman ochre.\n          yellow.        ochre.\n\n\n\n\nAPPENDIX.\n\n\nAlthough we intended to only describe the printing processes without the\nuse of silver salts, we thought it would be well to complete this work by\ngiving the most practical and interesting processes ever published to\nobtain permanent photographs; as they may give rise in the hand of\nexperimenters to useful applications.\n\nFrom time to time processes are published under “queer” names, which are\nbased on the well known actions of reagents on the ferric salts reduced by\nlight.  They are derived from those described in the following pages.\n\nWe call specially the attention of the reader to the process of Poitevin,\nby which one can experiment with every ferric salts, citrate, lactate,\noxalate, tartrate, benzoate, etc., by simply exciting with the\ncorresponding acid.  Observe that to obtain good results the paper should\nbe strongly sized; it is a sine qua non, although not recommended by\nPoitevin.\n\n\n\nC.J. BURNETT’S PROCESS(1857).\n\n\n“A capital process for many purposes,” says Mr. Burnett, “is to float or\n_steep_ the paper in a mixed solution of bichromate of potash and sulphate\nof copper, as for Hunt’s chromotype process.(36) I have mixed gelatine, or\noccasionally grape sugar, or both with the solution;(37) but instead of\ndeveloping it with nitrate of silver, as in chromotype, wash out the salt\nunaltered by light, and develop by floating on a solution of ferrocyanate\nof potassium.  The purple red color of the copper salt which now forms the\npicture may be modified or changed in many ways,(38) viz., by soaking the\npicture, after the ferrocyanate of potassium has been washed out of the\nlights, in a solution of sulphate of iron.  Solutions of gallic acid,\ntannic acid with alkalies of carbonate, may also be employed to modify or\nchange the color.  This process has the advantage that one may regulate\nthe exact tone (black or useful neutral tint) to the greatest nicety by\nthe time we allow the print to remain in the iron toning bath.”\n\n\n\nGODEFROY’S PROCESS (1858).\n\n\nFloat the paper upon the following solution for three minutes and hang it\nup to dry:\n\nUranium nitrate   30 to 60 parts\nSilver nitrate    8 parts\nWater             100 parts\n\n(39)\n\nThe sensitiveness increases in proportion to the quantity of uranium\nnitrate.  With the above formula the paper can be exposed in the camera,\nor, for printing, under a negative cliché.\n\nIn printing an exposure of five seconds in diffused light gives an image\nperfectly visible, and a grayish black tone; ten seconds gives a vigorous\nimage almost of a black color; in from fifteen to twenty seconds the image\nis very strong, with the color of an engraving. In sunshine the action is\nnecessarily much more rapid.\n\nThe impression is developed by immersion in\n\nFerrous sulphate   8 parts\nTartaric acid      4 parts\nSulphuric acid     1 part\nWater              100 parts\n\nThe image is rapidly developed. It is fixed by washing in water.\n\n\n\nDE LA BLANCHERE’S PROCESS (1858).\n\n\nUranium nitrate   25 parts\nDistilled water   100 parts\n\nFilter the solution and keep it in the dark.\n\nThe paper should be sized with a gelatine solution at 5 per 100 of water,\nand, when dry, kept in the dark.(40) It is sensitized by floating five\nminutes.\n\nThe exposure under a negative varies from fifteen to twenty minutes in the\nshade, and from one to three minutes, at the most, in sunshine.  As a\nrule, it is advisable to somewhat underexpose in order that the\ndevelopment be regular, progressive, under control.\n\nThe image is developed by floating, or immersion in\n\nSilver nitrate       2 parts\nDistilled water      100 parts\nNitrate acid, C.P.   a trace\n\nWhen the image is intense enough it is washed in several changes of water,\nthen toned in a solution of gold at 1 per 1,000 of water acidified with\ntraces of hydrochloride acid.(41)\n\nThe following bath develops slowly, and gives very rich purple tones\nwithout toning:\n\nNitrate of silver    3 parts\nNitrate of uranium   1 part\nNitrate of cadmium   1 part\nAlcohol              10 parts\nWater                100 parts\nNitric acid          traces\n\n_The developing solutions should be as little acid as possible, but not\nneutral, for then the proofs would be veiled and grayish._\n\nThe image can also be developed in a solution of gold, or in a very weak\nsolution of mercuric chloride at 1 per 10,000.  The proof must be\nextremely well printed and left for from two to five minutes in the\nmercuric solution.  If the time of exposure is right, the image will\nchange but little in the solution, and will take, when treated with silver\nnitrate, the most splendid tones.\n\nThe proofs should be carefully washed when finished.  If they were\ndeveloped with silver, they must be immersed in diluted aqueous ammonia,\nwhich will perfectly clear the whites.  If developed with chloride of\ngold, the water should be heated to 60 to 80 deg. C. (140 to 176 deg.\nFahr.)\n\n\n\nHOUDOY’S PROCESS (1858.)\n\n\nThe paper is floated upon a lukewarm solution of gelatine at 5:100, and\nwhen dry, on a bath of uranium at 10 or 15 per 100 of water.  After\nexposure to the sun the image is developed with a solution of silver\nnitrate acidified with acetic acid.  The exposure varies, according to the\nnature of the negative, from one to ten minutes; it must be long enough\nfor the image being developed in from thirty to forty seconds.  It is then\nremoved from the silver bath and placed in the following:\n\nFerrous sulphate   3 to 8 parts\nAcetic acid        2 parts\nWater              100 parts\n\nIn this bath the image takes a great vigor and appears entirely on the\nsurface of the paper.  When the proof has been too long exposed it should\nbe washed slightly before placing it in the iron bath.  Developed, the\nimage is, generally, of a sepia tone, which can be turned to black by a\nsolution of chloride of gold, 1:1,000, washing afterwards as usual.\n\n\n\nNIÈPCE DE ST. VICTOR’S PROCESS (1859).\n\n\nRed Prints.\n\n\nFloat the paper for fifteen or twenty seconds on a 20 per cent. solution\nof nitrate of uranium and dry before the fire in the dark room.  This\npaper can be prepared many days before use.  Expose in sunshine from eight\nto ten minutes, according to the intensity of the light and the quality of\nthe negative, then wash in moderately warm water (50 to 60 deg. C.) for a\nfew seconds.  This done, immerse in a solution of red prussiate of potash\nat 2 per cent. of water; in a few moments the proof will become of a fine\nblood-red color, like “sanguine.”  Wash, etc.\n\n\nGreen Prints.\n\n\nMake a red print as above described, immerse it for a few minutes in a\nsolution of nitrate of cobalt and dry it without washing.  Fix then in a\nsolution of sulphate of iron at 20 per cent. of water and 4 of sulphuric\nacid.  Wash and dry before the fire.\n\n\nViolet Prints.\n\n\nPrepare the paper in the uranium bath, expose, wash and develop in a\nsolution of chloride of gold, 1:200, until the proof has assumed a fine\nviolet color.  Wash in several changes of water.\n\n\nBlue Prints.\n\n\nSensitize the paper with a red prussiate of potash solution at 20 per 100.\nLet dry, expose until the proof is slightly blue; immerse it for five or\nten seconds in a saturated solution of bichloride of mercury, wash only\nonce and immerse in a solution of oxalic acid—saturated when cold—heated\nto about 55 deg. C.  Wash in three or four waters and let dry\nspontaneously.\n\n\nBlack Prints.\n\n\nFloat the paper on a mixture by equal volumes of a solution of iron\nperchloride and another of uranium nitrate, each at 10 per 100 of water.\nExpose and develop on a saturated solution of gallic acid.\n\n\n\n                    DR. T.L. PHIPSON’S PROCESS (1861).\n\n\nTake a solution of perchloride of iron and, having precipitated the\nperoxide with ammonia, collect the precipitate on a filter and wash it\nwith boiling water.  Add the precipitate in excess to a warm solution of\noxalic acid.  A beautiful emerald green solution is obtained, which must\nbe a little concentrated by evaporation and then set aside in a dark room\nfor use.  The paper is floated for ten (?) minutes upon the green solution\nof ferric oxalate, to which has been added a little oxalate of ammonia and\nhung up to dry in the dark.\n\nExpose under a negative for from ten to twenty minutes, according to the\nweather, and wash well the paper with rain water.  Spring water will not\ndo on account of the lime it may contain, which will form oxalate of lime\nin the paper (insoluble).  When all the non-decomposed oxalate is washed\nfrom the proof, a feeble image of oxalate of protoxide of iron, scarcely\nvisible, is left on the paper.  To develop it and to obtain the vigor, the\ntone and color of silver prints proceed as follows:\n\nPlunge the proof for a little while in a (weak) solution of permanganate\nof potassium to which a few drops of ammonia have been added; in the bath\nthe image becomes brown and distinctly visible.  It is then withdrawn and\nimmersed in a solution of pyrogallic acid for half an hour, after which it\nis washed and dried.\n\nThe image thus obtained can hardly be distinguished from silver prints;\nthe tone is soft, brilliant and permanent.\n\nThis process is quite original and interesting.  The theory is as follows:\nUnder the action of light the ferric oxalate is reduced in the ferrous\nsalt, insoluble, which, after the print has been cleared from the ferric\noxalate, is oxidized and reduced into ferric oxide by the alkalized\npermanganate, the latter then forming colored compounds with reagents.\n\nIt has been lately published in England under the name of “kallitype,” a\nnew process—or old, ad libitum—which consists in developing the image in\nferrous oxalate by a peculiar silver compound whose formula is given\nbelow.  The paper is prepared by brushing with a strong solution of\nneutral ferric oxalate dried rapidly—which is a sine qua non when using\ndeliquescent salts; and after exposure the image is developed, etc.\n\nSilver nitrate         50 grains\nSodium citrate         800 grains\nPotassium bichromate   1 to 2 grains\nWater                  10 ounces\n\n“Dissolve the silver nitrate in 1 ounce of water, the citrate and\nbichromate in the remainder and mix.  The precipitate—silver citrate and\nchromate—is then dissolved by adding 1 dram of ammonia .880, and after 35\ndrops of strong nitric acid has been added the solution is ready for use.”\n\nThis process reminds us that of Robert Hunt (1842), and that of more\nrecent date (1863), of Borlinetto, who developed the image in black with a\nsilver nitrate alcoholic solution, 1:500, and after washing the picture in\na solution of citric acid, 1:10, fixed it by aqueous ammonia.  But,\nalthough that is not absolutely necessary, we would advise one working\nthis, or similar processes in which a silver salt is employed for\ndeveloping, to fix the image, after treatment with citric acid to clear\nthe proofs from iron salts, in a solution of ammonium sulphocyanate—which\nhas not the injurious effect of sodium thiosulphate (hyposulphite)—in\norder to prevent the paper to be tinged by the reduction of the silver\nnitrate which is mechanically retained in its fiber.\n\nThe solution of ammonium sulphocyanate should be compounded with auric\nchloride to tone the picture at the same time it is fixed; thus:\n\nAmmonium sulphocyanate   35   parts\nGold terchloride         0.15 part\nWater                    350   parts\n\nThe solution can be used over again.\n\nIn the processes devised by Dr. Phipson, Monckhoven and other authorities,\nthe double ammonio-ferric oxalate is rightly recommended instead of the\nsimple oxalate.  Not only is the preparation more sensitive to the\nluminous action, but better half tones are obtained. As usual, it is\nadvantageous to size the paper with starch.\n\nThe ammonio-ferric oxalate is prepared by precipitating ferric chloride or\nsulphate by aqueous ammonia, then washing the precipitate collected on a\nfilter until the washing water be neutral or does not evolve the smell of\nammonia.  The precipitate is then placed in an evaporating dish, and by\nsmall quantity is added a hot solution of ammonium oxalate until it is\nnearly (not entirely) dissolved, when the solution is set aside for a few\nhours, then filtered and evaporated to crystallization.  For use, the\ncrystals of ammonio-ferric oxalate are dissolved in the proportion of 1\nfor 5 of distilled water.  The solution as well as the crystals should be\nkept in the dark.\n\nIf one object to the trouble of crystallizing, the solution can be\nprepared by dissolving the ferric oxide in a hot solution of 30 parts of\nammonium oxalate and 25 parts of oxalic acid in 180 parts of water\nobserving that the oxide must be in excess.(42)\n\nThe following sensitizing solution gives also excellent results:\n\nAmmonio-ferric oxalate   10 parts\nAmmonio-ferric lactate   4 parts\nWater                    100 parts\n\nAfter exposure, which varies from five to ten minutes, according to the\nintensity of the light and the printing quality of the negatives, the\npicture appears negative from formation of ferrous oxalate.  It may be\ndeveloped in a great many ways: by a solution of silver nitrate at 2 or 3\nper cent. of water acidified slightly by an organic acid—citric acid, for\nexample—or a diluted solution of ammonio-nitrate of silver, which most\nlikely constitutes the best developer; the image is black and consists of\nmetallic silver and ferric oxide, with formation of silver oxalate, which\ndissolve in the ammonia.  If the print be treated by a weak solution of\naqueous ammonia, the image turns green, then brown, and if, before the\nlatter coloration is obtained, gallic acid or pyrogallol be added, the\nimage becomes bluish-black or brown-black. In the same circumstances\ntannin (gallo-tannin) produces a blue-black image; catechu-tannin(43) and\nquino-tannin give green, etc. Employed as a developer, potassium\nferricyanate develops an image in prussian blue, and auric chloride one in\nthe characteristic violet metallic gold.  To fix the images obtained by\nthe latter reactions, it suffices to wash them in a few changes of water,\nand, if developed with silver, they can be toned by any of the alkaline\nsolutions of auric chloride used in the printing out silver process, etc.\n\nThe photographs obtained by all these processes are permanent.\n\n\n\nDR. J.B. OBERNETTER’S PROCESS (1863).\n\n\nCopper chloride             100 parts\nFerric chloride, sol. sp.   13 parts\ngr. 1.5\nHydrochloric acid, conc.    12 parts\nC. P.\nWater                       1,000 parts\n\nFloat the paper on this solution for about two minutes and hang it up to\ndry.  The keeping quality of the prepared paper is remarkable; it has been\nkept for two years without apparent change; its sensitiveness is at least\none-third greater than that of silver albumen paper.  Unless developed\nwithin an hour or two, the vigor of the proof is much impaired; after\ntwenty-four hours a print can be taken over on the same.\n\nWhen exposed, only a faint image is visible.  It should be fixed in the\nfollowing solution:\n\nPotassium sulphocyanate   12 parts\nSulphuric acid, conc.     1 part\nSensitizing solution      10 to 12 parts\nWater                     1,000 parts\n\nA print is floated on this solution, face downward, for three or four\nminutes, taking care to agitate the liquid as little as possible; the\nprint is afterwards immersed and another one floated in its place, thus\nproceeding until all the prints are immersed or the solution can hold no\nmore.  A fresh solution is then added to strengthen it: the older the\nsolution the more rapidly and better it works.  In this developer copper\ncyanide is precipitated on the parts acted on by light, and this exactly\nin the proportion to the luminous action.  The time of immersion depends\non the method selected to finish the proofs; it its from five minutes to\nhalf an hour.  If the proof is immersed for, say, twenty-four hours, the\nimage comes out in a relief which may bring the shadows to two lines in\ndepth.  When well developed and thoroughly washed, the proof can be dried\nand the subsequent operations made at any convenient time.\n\nVarious processes may be employed to give to these proofs the tone\nrequired; thus: the prints well washed are placed in a solution of\nferricyanate of potassium at 6 to 12 per 100 of water, where they take a\nred color increasing in intensity.  If left over night the color becomes a\nsplendid velvet deep red with perfect clear whites.  To obtain the color\nof silver photographs one hour’s immersion is sufficient.  After this\noperation the proofs are washed until the water is no more tinged yellow.\n\nBy immersion in\nFerrous sulphate      100 parts\nIron sesquichloride   40 parts\nHydrochloric acid     80 parts\nWater                 200 to 300 parts\n\nthe proofs undergo the following gradation of colors: red, reddish violet,\nblue-violet, black and greenish black.  As soon as the desired color is\nobtained, the proofs are washed in acidified water and dried.\n\nThe most beautiful purple violet is obtained by leaving the proofs in the\niron solution until green-black, and then washing for a moment in a dilute\nsolution of sub-acetate of lead.\n\nA brown-black may be produced by treatment, after washing, with an\nammoniacal solution of hypermanganate of potash.\n\nA weak solution of nitrate of silver also yields very fine pictures, but\nthe exposure should be very short, and the proofs must be fixed in water\ncontaining a small quantity of oxalate of ammonia.\n\nIn order to impart to the proofs the gloss of silver photographs, they\nshould be albumenized in the ordinary manner, and the albumen\ninsolubilized by well known means.\n\nThe chemical actions in this process I explain in the following manner: On\nthe paper there are Fe2Cl3 and CuCl, the latter in excess.  By the action\nof light, and according to the transparency of the negative, Fe2Cl3 is\nreduced to FeCl, while CuCl suffers no alteration.\n\nIf the paper be immediately placed in an _absolutely_ dry room after\nexposure, the picture remains unchanged.  In a moist atmosphere FeCl\nattracts moisture and, with a part of CuCl, is so decomposed that Fe2Cl3\nis formed together with Cu2Cl.\n\nAfter this action has commenced, if the proof be not immediately immersed\nin a solution of sulphocyanate of potassium, Cu2Cl passes over to a higher\ncombination of chlorine, and the paper is again fit to be impressed anew\nby the action of light.\n\nAs long as FeCl or even Cu2Cl is present, if the print is immersed in the\nsulphocyanate solution, sulphocyanate of copper is immediately formed on\nthe reduced parts, while on the others the sulphocyanide of copper, formed\nand dissolved by the sulphocyanide of potassium in excess, becomes decom‐\nposed with water in soluble sulphocyanide of copper and deposited as such\non the parts already covered with the salt.\n\nFrequently the prints appear yellow from formation of the double\nsulphocyanide of copper, but the color disappears by washing in water.\nRed coloration is due to decomposition into ferrocyanide of copper.\n\n\n\nL. LIESEGANG’S PROCESS (1865).\n\n\nPour ammonia into a nitrate of uranium solution, wash the precipitate of\nuranate of ammonia in distilled water, then dissolve in citric acid.\n\nMix this solution of citrate of uranium and a little of a solution of\nchloride of gold with a paste prepared by dissolving tapioca in hot water.\nThe quantity of chloride of gold must be small and the heat not too great,\notherwise the gold would be reduced.\n\nSpread the mixture with a sponge on the paper, which takes a brilliant\nyellow color, and expose when quite dry; the proofs have the delicacy and\nvigor of albumen prints.\n\nThe proofs come from the frame with a bluish-black color; they should not\nbe toned, but merely fixed by washing until the yellow color of the paper\nhas disappeared.\n\nThe color of the picture can be changed to a purple by a solution of\nchloride of tin.\n\n\n\nGUARBASSI’S PROCESS (1867).\n\n\nThe paper is floated in the dark for four or five minutes on a saturated\nsolution of bichromate of potash.  When dry, it is printed a little longer\nthan for silver prints and afterwards floated, face upwards, on a water\nbath until all the unaltered bichromate is dissolved.  It is then immersed\nin the following solution, which improve by use and tones the pictures to\na reddish color:\n\nSaturated solution       4 parts\nnitrate of mercury, as\nfree from acid as\npossible\nSaturated solution       1 part\nbichromate of potash\nDistilled water          28 parts\n\nThis solution should be prepared, filtered and allowed to stand for some\ntime before use.  The print is left in the bath until it has assumed an\nintense red color, the whites remaining perfectly pure.  It is then washed\nand put in another bath to obtain a brownish tint.  This bath is thus\ncomposed:\n\nConc. aqueous ammonia   2 parts\nDistilled water         100 parts\n\nThe print must be immersed at once, and when, in a short time, it has\nassumed the proper color, it should be washed immediately.\n\nThe picture is toned in a very diluted solution of chloride of gold,\n1:7,000, in which the color passes from a light brown to a deep black or a\nviolet black tone, when it is washed in two changes of water.\n\n\n\nA. POITEVIN’S PROCESS (1870).\n\n\n“I use a paper prepared with iron sesquioxide rendered sensitive to light\nby tartaric or, better, citric acid in concentrated solution.  This paper,\nafter desiccation and exposure to light, possesses the property of\nreducing the solution of silver nitrate and that of chloride of gold, and\nof turning blue with a solution of potassium ferncyanate in the parts\nwhere light has reduced the iron sesquichloride into the oxide at the\nminimum.”\n\n“To coat the paper with an equal layer of iron sesqnioxide, I brush it\nwith a tuft of fine linen dipped in a solution of iron perchloride at 10\nor 12 per cent. of water, and dry the sheets in the dark.  I immerse\nafterwards these sheets, one after the other, in a tray containing aqueous\nammonia, in such a manner as to well wet each sheet successively.  A\nsufficient number of sheets being immersed, I pour off the ammonia in a\nvial, and, in the tray, I wash them several times, and remove them one by\none to hang them up to dry, even in full light, the iron sesquioxide not\nbeing sensitive to light.”\n\n“The paper can be prepared in quantities beforehand.  To use it I apply\nupon each sheet a solution of citric acid at 30 or 35 per cent. of\nwater(44)—which may be done by daylight—and let them dry in the dark.”\n\n“Exposed under a negative of the ordinary intensity, the paper is\nimpressed in sunshine in a few minutes; in the shade it requires about the\nsame time as chloride of silver paper.”\n\n“After exposure the image is not visible, and without being obliged to\nshelter it from light, I immerse the print in a solution containing about\n1 per cent. of silver nitrate.  This solution can be used over and over\nagain, by adding to it a little of the silver salt.  It does not become\nturpid by use; it simply turns slightly green from formation of iron\nnitrate.  The image appears soon and rapidly becomes vigorous; in half an\nhour it will be completely developed.  When the exposure is sufficient the\ncolor is deep sepia, but not so intense if the quantity of citric acid is\nfeeble.  No fixing is necessary; it suffices to wash in several changes of\nwaters.”\n\n“The image can be toned with great facility by a weak solution of gold or\nof platinum chloride, or, better, by a mixture of these two salts.  If the\nimpressed paper be treated by a very diluted solution of potassium\nferrocyanate, one obtains very pretty blue proofs.”\n\n“A weak solution of gold chloride develops a violet image. A solution of\nplatinum chloride has no effect.”\n\n“All the various phases of this printing method can be followed in full\n(diffused) light; there is only the desiccation of the paper when\nsensitized with citric acid, which requires to be done in the dark.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK PHOTOGRAPHIC REPRODUCTION PROCESSES***\n\n\n\nCREDITS\n\n\nDecember 24, 2007\n\n            Project Gutenberg edition 10\n            Martin Schub\n\n\n\nA WORD FROM PROJECT GUTENBERG\n\n\nThis file should be named 24016-0.txt or 24016-0.zip.\n\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\n\n\n    http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/0/1/24016/\n\n\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one — the old editions will be\nrenamed.\n\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no one\nowns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and\nyou!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission\nand without paying copyright royalties.

Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are\nparticularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.\n\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.\nCompliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable\neffort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these\nrequirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not\nreceived written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or\ndetermine the status of compliance for any particular state visit\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\n\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have\nnot met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against\naccepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us\nwith offers to donate.\n\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any\nstatements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the\nUnited States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\n\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation methods\nand addresses.

Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with\nanyone. For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™\neBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\n\nProject Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions,\nall of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright\nnotice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance\nwith any particular paper edition.\n\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook’s eBook\nnumber, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed\n(zipped), HTML and others.\n\nCorrected _editions_ of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the\nold filename and etext number. The replaced older file is renamed.\n_Versions_ based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\n\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\n\n\n    http://www.gutenberg.org\n\n\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how\nto make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation,\nhow to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email\nnewsletter to hear about new eBooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n***FINIS***\n\x0c')
